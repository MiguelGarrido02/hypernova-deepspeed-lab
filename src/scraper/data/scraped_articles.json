The main goal of this collaboration is the development of advanced artificial intelligence solutions that enhance athletic performance. Leveraging Multiverse Computing’s expertise in AI model optimization and quantum computing, tools are being developed to improve decision-making, game analysis, and personalized training-setting a new benchmark for the integration of disruptive technologies in professional football.\n\nThePlayer Injury Risk Monitor by Singularitysoftware is built on an artificial intelligence engine inspired by quantum physics that transforms how elite teams manage player wellbeing and performance. By integrating historical injury data, real-time information on training loads and minutes played, subjective physical assessments, and external factors such as weather conditions or travel schedules, the technology identifies patterns and risk variables with high accuracy. Using this data, the system calculates individualized risk profiles and enables tailored adjustments to training and recovery programs, supporting more informed decision-making to maximize player performance and reduce injury risk.\n\nAccording toBixen Calzón, Head of the Evaluation and Data Unit at Real Sociedad, “tests carried out with our department have allowed us to estimate, at a theoretical level, that the application of this program could predict more than 33% of injuries. These simulations were based on historical data and internal modeling, and therefore should not be interpreted as outcomes achieved in real competition.”\n\nIraia Ibarzabal, Chief Growth Officer at Multiverse Computing, adds: “For Multiverse Computing, partnering with Real Sociedad on this project has been an opportunity to demonstrate how quantum-inspired AI can have a real impact and make a difference in such a competitive sector as elite sports. This initiative reflects our commitment to developing solutions that deliver tangible value-helping improve athletic performance, protect players’ health, and optimize club investment.”\n\n\n\nInjuries in European Football: A Growing Challenge for Clubs\n\nDuring the 2023–2024 season, injuries across the major European leagues resulted in a total cost of €732 million for clubs. an increase of 5% compared to the previous season. Over the past four years, 96 clubs accumulated 14,000 injuries, generating a combined cost of €2.3 billion.\n\nEuropean football continues to experience nearly one injury per match, with an estimated cost of €172,975 per game. This highlights the significant sporting and economic impact of injuries, particularly on the development of young players, who lose an average of 35 competitive days per injury. This limits their progress and affects club planning.\n\nThrough this collaboration agreement, Real Sociedad and Multiverse Computing are currently developing new technological solutions such as academy potential prediction, with the goal of further driving innovation in the sports sector.

        "date": "November 19, 2025",
        "content": "DeepSeek R1 Slim by CompactifAI has 300 billion fewer parameters than the original model, directly halving memory consumption and deployment costs while still maintaining accuracy on all deep reasoning tasks. Further, Multiverse removed the model's fine-tuned censorship on politically sensitive topics. The result is the first highly-efficient, unbiased and uncompromising variant of DeepSeek R1, now available through the CompactifAI API or AWS Marketplace.\n\nDeepSeek R1: A Reasoning & Problem-Solving Powerhouse\n\nIn January 2025, DeepSeek R1 gained global recognition for its exceptional performance across mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning benchmarks, rivaling or surpassing its contemporaries. It quickly gained traction for both its raw power and open-source nature, democratizing access to top-tier AI capabilities and spurring further innovation within the global research community.\n\nThe model's ability to perform chain-of-thought reasoning, where it breaks down problems into smaller, logical steps, has been particularly lauded, making it a crucial tool for both academic and commercial applications that require deep analytical capabilities.\n\nCost & Bias Limitations Hinder Adoption\n\nWhile DeepSeek R1 is open source, running the massive model is a significant financial undertaking.Hardware costsfor the 671-billion parameter model soar well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Operational expenses for power, cooling, and data center space further inflate the investment, putting the powerful model out of reach for most organizations.\n\nDeepSeek has released distilled versions of R1 along with DeepSeek-V2 and V2-Lite. All of these models offer greater compute efficiency but none of them fully stack up to R1. If your tasks revolve around complex, multi-step reasoning, logical inference, mathematical or coding problems, or structured outputs, DeepSeek-R1 far outpaces its distilled and lite variants.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek R1’s sheer size and hardware requirements, the model’s baked-in political censorship presents significant drawbacks. Developed in China, the model evades questions on sensitive topics like Tiananmen Square and Taiwan, while promoting a state-approved narrative on history and global politics. This censorship makes the model fundamentally unreliable and unsuitable for journalism, research, or any application requiring objective, comprehensive information.\n\nUnleashing The Full Power of DeepSeek R1\n\nUsing CompactifAI, our proprietary compression technology, we were able to directly eliminate these limitations and deliver an uncompromising variant of R1.\n\nOur software is based on quantum-inspired tensor networks, which allows us to identify and remove the least important parameters that contribute little to the model's overall performance. Additionally, it allows us to isolate and remove weights tied to specific learned behaviors, such as censorship, without degrading the model's core knowledge.\n\nOur technology enabled us to remove 300B+ parameters from R1 and locate specific weights storing political topic restrictions, and isolate and remove them from the model. Our team then went through an extensive healing process across multiple GPUs to restore the full accuracy of the model.\n\nEvaluations\n\nWe tested the model across MMLU, Winogrande, Hellaswag, BoolQ, GSM8K and MMLU-Pro to ensure model performance and accuracy remained consistent with the original.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compressed version of DeepSeek R1 only had minimal accuracy loss on these tests.\n\nWe also conducted extensive tests to determine that all of the political censorship baked into the original model no longer had any bearing on model outputs. Example outputs are below:\n\nDeepSeek R1 censored output example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeepSeek R1 uncensored output example with CompactifAI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow We’re Navigating Responsible Model Restoration\n\nAdjusting how an AI model handles restricted information is a responsibility we approach with care and transparency. Our objective in refining DeepSeek R1 was to restore its full analytical and factual capability on globally relevant topics while maintaining strong safety boundaries and respect for diverse legal and cultural frameworks.\n\nThis work is guided by technical neutrality. Using our CompactifAI compression and restoration framework, we identified and adjusted parameters associated with topic-level restrictions that limited model completeness. The process was designed to enhance reasoning consistency and factual coverage without altering DeepSeek R1’s safety systems or alignment behavior.\n\nWe recognize that this form of model restoration introduces new ethical considerations. To ensure transparency and accountability, we have established an independent ethics and safety committee composed of both internal experts and external advisors in AI governance, data ethics, and international law. This committee reviews our research methodology, deployment practices, and alignment with international standards such as the OECD AI Principles and the EU AI Act.\n\nOur guiding principles are:\n\nThis is a continuous process of research and dialogue. We invite collaboration from global scientists, ethicists, and policymakers to advance best practices for ensuring that AI systems can responsibly reflect diverse perspectives while preserving factual integrity and user safety.\n\nTo learn more about our initial ethics committee and how we view our responsibility, visit:https://multiversecomputing.com/our-team.\n\nClickherefor API access to DeepSeek R1 Slim.

        "date": "November 12, 2025",
        "content": "The AI model compression process also significantly reduces storage and computing needs, with cuts of up to 80%, and lowers energy consumption by up to 75%.\n\nThe original models that have been compressed are open source.\n\nMadrid, November 12th 2025 - Telefónica and Multiverse Computing have reached an important milestone in the application of artificial intelligence in the telecommunications sector by successfully compressing and fine-tuning two large language models (LLMs), based on machine learning and natural language processing, for internal use in customer service.\n\nThese compressed models are expected to be used in the near future within the chat system that supports Customer Service agents as part of the “Movistar por ti” initiative, Movistar’s new, more agile, proactive and closer approach to customer care. The goal is to optimize response times for queries while reducing energy consumption in the systems.\n\nThe solution, based on AI model compression, delivers major improvements in speed, efficiency, energy usage and costs, all while maintaining the accuracy of the information that helps agents manage customer service more effectively.\n\nSpecifically, Multiverse Computing has applied cutting-edge quantum-inspired techniques to Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.3 70B models, pre-trained language models (LLMs) that can be applied to a wide variety of intelligent assistant use cases.\n\nThe result achieved is an 80% reduction in model size, which implies a considerable decrease in storage needs, while maintaining the quality of the generated responses.\n\nAnother important aspect is the environmental dimension: in addition to being able to run in the cloud, the compressed models developed can be deployed directly on Telefónica’s network, including local (on-premise) facilities. This makes it possible to reduce energy consumption by up to 75% compared to uncompressed models.\n\nIn this way, this improvement also reinforces Telefónica and Multiverse Computing’s joint commitment to reducing the environmental impact of technology.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to local deployment in Telefónica’s central offices, where 100% of the electricity comes from renewable sources and there is continuous work to improve efficiency, the operator has also managed to reduce the CO₂ emissions associated with the use of artificial intelligence in this case.\n\nAs for the original models that have been compressed (Llama), they are open-source models, in line with Telefónica’s goal of promoting openness, security and technological neutrality to foster standards and accelerate AI adoption.\n\nUltimately, Telefónica’s future application of the compressed models developed will deliver major operational efficiencies in the use of artificial intelligence, as they will make it possible to maintain the original quality of large language models (LLMs) while using much more modest hardware and lowering query costs for the models both in the cloud and on-premise. On top of this, energy consumption at Telefónica’s facilities will be reduced to a minimum.\n\nA pioneering collaboration for scalable AI\n\nThis collaboration highlights the strategic potential of combining Telefónica’s scale with Multiverse Computing’s deep technical innovation. By deploying a compressed, high-performance and environmentally efficient AI solution, both companies reaffirm their leadership in developing more accessible and scalable AI for enterprise use.\n\nAbout Multiverse Computing\n\nMultiverse Computing is a leader in AI model compression. Its expertise in quantum software and artificial intelligence has led to the development of CompactifAI, a groundbreaking AI model compressor. CompactifAI compresses LLMs by up to 95% with only a 2–3% loss in accuracy. CompactifAI models reduce compute requirements and unlock new use cases across multiple industries.

        "date": "November 10, 2025",
        "content": "The Architecture Behind the Magic\n\nAt the heart of CompactifAI lies a federated model architecture that decides, intelligently and autonomously, which AI system should respond to you, local or cloud. Llama 3.1 Slim (Gilda), the on-device LLM, handles quick, lightweight, and privacy-sensitive queries. Running fully offline, it is your AI companion that does not need internet connection. DeepSeek R1 Slim, the cloud-based compressed model by CompactifAI, takes over when reasoning gets deeper or the question demands broader context. Overseeing both is CompactifAI Router, the orchestrator model that determines who should answer what. Think of it as a cognitive traffic controller, assessing each question’s complexity, privacy sensitivity, and latency tolerance before routing it to the right brain.\n\n️How It Works\n\nWhen you ask your iPhone or laptop a question, CompactifAI Router evaluates it. If it is simple enough, the local Llama 3.1 8B Slim answers instantly. If it requires heavy reasoning or access to global data, sends it to DeepSeek R1 Slim in the cloud. The response returns seamlessly, giving the impression of one unified AI. Even when airplane Wi-Fi fades in and out, the system adapts. You never lose your AI assistant, because your AI never leaves you.\n\nA New Standard for AI Efficiency\n\nThis is not just a neat demo. It is a glimpse at the next paradigm of AI deployment, one that makes models smarter, safer, and more personal. Privacy by design ensures your data stays on your device for simple tasks. Latency-aware intelligence allows CompactifAI to dynamically decide when to go local versus remote.\n\nBut efficiency is not only about performance it is about cost. By routing only complex queries to the cloud, CompactifAI dramatically reduces the number of high-cost inference calls. Routine, lightweight tasks stay local, requiring no data transfer, no server time, and no cloud GPU usage. This hybrid strategy lowers operational costs for both individuals and enterprises, without sacrificing accuracy or responsiveness. The outcome is a leaner, greener, and more affordable AI powerful when needed, frugal when it can be.\n\nCompactifAI’s orchestration shines as the router hands off a simple query to the local Llama 3.1 8B Slim and routes a complex one to DeepSeek R1 Slim through unstable Wi-Fi, proving that AI can think locally and globally at once. The cloud goes dark, but your AI does not.\n\nCompactifAI shows that the next AI revolution is not about bigger models, it is about smarter collaboration between them. We are moving toward an era where your phone, your laptop, and the cloud all become parts of one distributed intelligence. At Multiverse Computing, we call this philosophy AI Unplugged.\n\n\n\nWatch the Demo: “AI, Unplugged”\n\n\n\n\n\nmultiversecomputing.com/compactifai"

        "content": "On a laptop, the engineers demonstrate how a drone can pinpoint precisely what is in its sights. Using the ordinary workhorse computer processors known as CPUs, the device can identify encroaching enemy tanks and soldiers, for example, and zip only that information back to military units, using a compressed AI model that’s vastly cheaper and more energy-efficient than the behemoth large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT. “You need an AI system that is super-frugal,” says Enrique Lizaso Olmos, Multiverse’s CEO and one of four cofounders, as the program quickly picks out a tank. “The drones use very, very, very little energy,” he adds, even when monitoring a situation that “is getting more and more complex.”\n\nMultiverse, like its AI models, is currently small—predicted sales this year are a modest $25 million. But it’s onto a big idea. Its work focuses on compressing large language platforms, or LLMs, and creating smaller models, in the belief that most consumers and business customers can do just fine with lower-powered but thoughtfully designed AI that needs less power and fewer chips to run.\n\nSome experts question how well compressed AI models can truly perform. But the concept has plenty of believers. Multiverse’s clients include manufacturers, financial-services companies, utilities, and defense contractors, among them big names like Bosch, Moody’s, and Bank of Canada.\n\n\n\nMore recently, Multiverse has begun collaborating with Deloitte and Intel on running public services in the U.S., including a state Medicaid platform, using its SLMs. “There are tons and tons of applications where to a user you will not see any big difference,” says Burnie Legette, AI senior solutions architect for Intel’s government technologies group. But the savings to taxpayers are potentially huge. “To run an LLM is very, very expensive,” he says.\n\n\n\nBy focusing on creating super-small, affordable AI, Multiverse is tackling head-on an issue that has become increasingly urgent in Silicon Valley and in corporate C-suites. In the scramble to ramp up AI capabilities, many have begun wondering whether the giant investments AI requires will pay off—or whether the costs that LLMs’ power demands inflict on the environment will outweigh the benefits. (For its potential in addressing the latter issue, Multiverse earned a spot onFortune’s 2025 Change the World list.)\n\n\n\nRead the full article here: https://fortune.com/2025/10/09/artificial-intelligence-multiverse-computing-compressed-ai-models-slms/"

        "date": "September 25, 2025",
        "content": "SAN SEBASTIÁN, Spain, Sept. 24, 2025\n\nMultiverse Computing, the leader in quantum-inspired AI compression, today announced a collaboration with SOHMA AI to deploy the first behavioral AI platform for youth mental health support operating fully on user devices. Leveraging compressed models from Multiverse, SOHMA AI’s deployment demonstrates a critical breakthrough enabled by Edge AI: sophisticated behavioral analysis that runs entirely on consumer devices in real time, an early intervention opportunity previously thought to be impossible due to cloud-based computational limitations.\n\nNew AI Approach To Answer Youth In Crisis\n\nMental health challenges affect up to 1 in 3 elite youth athletes, with 58% of adolescent mental health conditions going undiagnosed in the United Kingdom alone. Current solutions remain largely reactive, clinical, and stigmatized, resulting in continued low adoption, late intervention, and widespread underreporting of psychological distress.\n\nSOHMA AI selected Multiverse’s compression technology to make possible what no digital system has yet achieved: reading unstructured non-verbal human signals and translating them into structured emotional insights – mood, focus, stress, mindset – in real time. This creates adaptive, emotionally responsive systems that work across mobile, wearables, AR/VR, and robotics.\n\nSOHMA’s first deployment is with elite athletes, integrating preventative mental health tools seamlessly into their digital lives and responding to their emotional and cognitive states in real time. The framework is designed to scale into digital health, education, gaming, and workforce wellbeing – anywhere human emotion and resilience matter.\n\nThe collaboration addresses what SOHMA AI’s CEO Lisa Franke calls a critical gap in current approaches. Franke adds, \"Digital systems today can’t understand how we feel. SOHMA changes that by creating the emotional intelligence layer for AI itself. To change the future of mental health, we need to meet young people where they are – on the pitch, in their games, and inside digital spaces they trust. Together with Multiverse, we’re making AI human-aware.\"\n\nThe technical challenge was substantial. Traditional behavioral AI requires significant computational power, limiting applications to research settings or cloud-dependent solutions unsuitable for real-time intervention.\n\nQuantum-Inspired Compression Solves Fundamental Compute Barrier\n\nMultiverse's CompactifAI uses quantum-inspired techniques to compress large language models by up to 95% with only 2-3% precision loss. This enables 4x–12x faster processing and 50%–80% lower inference costs, making it possible to run advanced AI models on devices ranging from smartphones to Raspberry Pi, and unleashing what Multiverse Computing CEO Enrique Lizaso describes as a new category of edge AI applications:\n\n\"Edge AI holds the potential to reshape industries of all shapes and sizes, but first the models need to actually fit on device,\" said Lizaso. “CompactifAI’s quantum-inspired compression algorithms open the door to high-performance AI at a fraction of the compute and cost.”\n\nLizaso adds: “Real-time behavioral AI was impossible on mobile devices until now – the computational requirements were simply too massive for consumer hardware. Our compression technology doesn't just make AI faster, it fundamentally changes what's possible. We're talking about shrinking models by 95% while maintaining accuracy, which means SOHMA can deliver the same behavioral analysis that required cloud supercomputers directly through a teenager's smartphone. From there, you can imagine infinite possibilities in the fields of digital therapeutics, education, gaming, and workforce wellness.\"\n\nSOHMA AI will first pilot the technology in elite football academies across the U.K. and U.S. The long-term roadmap expands across digital health, education, gaming, and robotics, making emotional intelligence a native capability of AI systems.\n\nMultiverse Computing is currently offering compressed versions of top Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models, with additional models planned for release soon. In June 2025, Multiverse announced that it had secured an additional $215 million in Series B funding from leading investors Bullhound Capital, HP Tech Ventures, Forgepoint Capital, and Toshiba. The investment will accelerate widespread adoption of CompactifAI models to transform the $106 billion AI inference market.\n\nFor more information about Multiverse Computing and CompactifAI, visit multiversecomputing.com.

        "content": "Most people think shrinking language models means sacrificing performance. Multiverse Computing changes that, and today we’re showing the world just how small highly-performant AI models can be.\n\nFollowing the release of a series of CompactifAI Slim models over the past several months, Multiverse is proud to unveil the Model Zoo, a new family of nano models that fundamentally debunks the assumption that full-power LLMs can’t run locally, and bigger = better AI models.\n\nEach model in the Model Zoo is named for the animal brain it could theoretically fit into—not as a gimmick, but as a concrete measure of just how small a sophisticated model can physically get.\n\nThe first two nano model releases, ChickenBrain and SuperFly by CompactifAI, represent a significant step forward in the AI industry's quest for leaner, greener and more efficient AI, and open up immediate, practical new domains for AI models.\n\n\n\nChickenBrain: Compressed Version of Llama 3.1 8B Outperforms Original\n\nChickenBrain is a compressed version of Meta’s Llama 3.1 model. This nano model with reasoning capabilities could theoretically run on hardware the size of a chicken’s brain (3,700 times smaller than what is typically required).\n\nWhen tested on a Macbook Pro and Raspberry Pi, ChickenBrain exceeded theperformance of Llama 3.1 8B across benchmarks—MMLU Pro, MATH500, GSM8K, and GPQA Diamond.\n\nChickenBrain is definitive proof that compressed models can outperform original versions, debunking conventional thinking about the size-performance tradeoff.\n\n\n\nSuperFly: Conversational AI, Anywhere\n\nSuperFly is a compressed version of the open-source model SmolLM2 135. It has 94M parameters and is so minuscule that it can reside within the tiny neural architecture of two common flies (15,000 times smaller than a chicken brain).\n\nDespite its compact size, the model maintains conversational fluency similar to larger AI systems. Super Fly’s small footprint makes it possible to run locally on any device without requiring internet connection.\n\nImmediate potential applications include:\n\n\n\nWhile Others Optimize, We Revolutionize\n\nWhile the rest of the AI industry rallies around techniques like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to combat the AI energy crisis, Multiverse’s novel, quantum-inspired approach has delivered a technical breakthrough with cascading effects.\n\nThe future of AI does not lie in ever-larger models and increasingly demanding hardware. It lies in ingenuity and new techniques that challenge the status quo.\n\nChickenBrain and Super Fly are availablehereby private request. Model Zoo nano models will be available via the CompactifAI API in the coming months.\n\nStay tuned for updates as Multiverse Computing continues to deliver the smallest and most powerful AI models in the world."

        "date": "June 25, 2025",
        "content": "Multiverse Computing, a Spanish company specializing in the advanced compression of artificial intelligence (AI) models, and PINQ², the Platform for Digital and Quantum Innovation of Quebec (Plateforme d’innovation numérique et quantique du Québec), announce a strategic partnership enabling local businesses to benefit from innovative technology that is both more efficient and less energy-intensive, with performances that retain the power and potential of AI. This collaboration also serves to formalize the expansion of Multiverse Computing in Quebec.\n\nThe CompactifAI compression technology developed by Multiverse Computing, inspired by the power of quantum and process simplification, makes it possible to greatly reduce the size of artificial intelligence models. The association with PINQ² enables the Quebec institution to act as a catalyst for this emerging technology which offers multiple benefits, all within a sovereign and protected environment.\n\nMultiverse Computing, Europe’s largest supplier of quantum software, is active in key sectors such as energy, life sciences, finance, cybersecurity and defense. In Quebec, its local commitment is built on its access to the powerful resources of PINQ²’s quantum platform, which provides a solid infrastructure upon which Quebec and Canadian companies can locally test large-scale, next- generation AI models, compressed and adapted to their needs.\n\nA greater role within a qualified ecosystem\n\n“Through this collaboration with PINQ², we are taking a concrete step toward a lasting presence in Quebec, while also expanding the practical applications of our CompactifAI compression technology in North America,” said Sam Mugel, Co-Founder and Technology Director of Multiverse Computing, as well as Manager of the company’s Canadian offices. “We want to play a greater role in Canada’s dynamic and collaborative AI ecosystem, which features highly qualified talent. WithPINQ2, all the ingredients for an excellent collaboration are in place.”\n\n“This partnership with Multiverse Computing reflects our mission, which is to enable companies of all sizes to access advanced technologies in a sovereign, sustainable, and high-performance environment”, said Marie-Claude Messier, General Manager of PINQ². “This association will have a positive impact on innovation in Quebec, in many fields, in addition to establishing eco-responsible practices in the use of AI. These aspects are important and significant.”\n\nA compressed, powerful and more eco-responsible AI\n\nBased on tensor networks, a formulation method for quantum systems that can analyze large, highly complex data sets, the CompactifAI solution greatly reduces the size of AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). For example, the new Llama 3.1 8B model, developed by IT giant Meta, is an extremely versatile, multilingual LLM. With such an LLM inevitably consuming extensive computing resources, the CompactifAI solution considerably reduces its size by 80%. This lowers operating costs, in addition to cutting energy consumption by 50%. Despite the advanced compression, AI models retain their accuracy, even increasing inference speed by a factor of 1.8x.\n\nThus, with regard to artificial intelligence, this new partnership between Multiverse Computing and PINQ2 brings significant benefits to Quebec and Canadian companies, including increased efficiency, the development of specialized AI models, as well as improved privacy and governance. Additionally, the compression of IA models makes them more portable, requiring less space for their installation on various devices.\n\nSupporting AI sovereignty\n\nThe strategic partnership between PINQ2 and Multiverse Computing also reinforces the principles of AI sovereignty, specifically in commerce, industry, science, and national security, by putting the emphasis on local use. Artificial intelligence is thus treated as a national resource, ensuring a country’s sovereignty by enabling it to rely more heavily on locally developed and hosted AI models or solutions. As PINQ2 is a trusted, proven and sovereign quantum platform, this offering will attract a greater number of local start-ups, companies and institutions, who can take advantage of Quebec’s effervescent AI ecosystem to develop their expertise and talents, therefore developing and shaping the solutions that will mark the quantum and sovereign future of the province and Canada."

        "content": "San Sebastian, Spain - June 12, 2025:Multiverse Computing, the global leader in quantum-inspired AI model compression, has developed CompactifAI, a compression technology capable of reducing the size of LLMs (Large Language Models) by up to 95% while maintaining model performance. Having spent 2024 developing the technology and rolling it out to initial customers, the company today announces a €189 million ($215 million) investment round.\n\nThe Series B will be led by Bullhound Capital with the support of world-class investors such as HP Tech Ventures, SETT, Forgepoint Capital International, CDP Venture Capital, Santander Climate VC, Quantonation, Toshiba and Capital Riesgo de Euskadi - Grupo SPRI. The company has brought on widespread support for this push with a range of international and strategic investors. The investment will accelerate widespread adoption to address the massive costs prohibiting the roll out of LLMs, revolutionizing the$106 billion AI inference market.\n\nLLMs typically run on specialized, cloud-based infrastructure thatdrives up data center costs. Traditional compression techniques—quantization and pruning—aim to address these challenges, but their resulting models significantly underperform original LLMs. With the development of CompactifAI, Multiverse discovered a new approach. CompactifAI models are highly-compressed versions of leading open source LLMs that retain original accuracy, are 4x-12x faster and yield a 50%-80% reduction in inference costs. These compressed, affordable, energy-efficient models can run on the cloud, on private data centers or—in the case of ultra compressed LLMs—directly on devices such as PCs, phones, cars, drones and even Raspberry Pi.\n\n“The prevailing wisdom is that shrinking LLMs comes at a cost. Multiverse is changing that,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, Founder and CEO of Multiverse Computing. “What started as a breakthrough in model compression quickly proved transformative—unlocking new efficiencies in AI deployment and earning rapid adoption for its ability to radically reduce the hardware requirements for running AI models. With a unique syndicate of expert and strategic global investors on board and Bullhound Capital as lead investor, we can now further advance our laser-focused delivery of compressed AI models that offer outstanding performance with minimal infrastructure.”\n\nCompactifAI was createdusing Tensor Networks, a quantum-inspired approach to simplifying neural networks. Tensor Networks is a specialized field of study pioneered by Román Orús, Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at Multiverse. “For the first time in history, we are able to profile the inner workings of a neural network to eliminate billions of spurious correlations to truly optimize all sorts of AI models,” said Orús. Compressed versions of top Llama, DeepSeek and Mistral modelsare available now, with additional models coming soon.\n\nPer Roman, Co-founder & Managing Partner, Bullhound Capital, said: “Multiverse’s CompactifAI introduces material changes to AI processing that address the global need for greater efficiency in AI, and their ingenuity is accelerating European sovereignty. Román Orús has convinced us that he and his team of engineers are developing truly world-class solutions in this highly complex and compute intensive field. Enrique Lizaso is the perfect CEO for rapidly expanding the business in a global race for AI dominance. I am also pleased to see that so many high-profile investors such as HP and Forgepoint decided to join the round. We welcome their participation.”\n\nTuan Tran, President of Technology and Innovation, HP Inc., commented: “At HP, we are dedicated to leading the future of work by providing solutions that drive business growth and enhance professional fulfillment. Our investment in Multiverse Computing supports this ambition. By making AI applications more accessible at the edge, Multiverse’s innovative approach has the potential to bring AI benefits of enhanced performance, personalization, privacy and cost efficiency to life for companies of any size.”\n\nDamien Henault, Managing Director, Forgepoint Capital International, said: “The Multiverse team has solved a deeply complex problem with sweeping implications. The company is well-positioned to be a foundational layer of the AI infrastructure stack. Multiverse represents a quantum leap for the global deployment and application of AI models, enabling smarter, cheaper and greener AI. This is only just the beginning of a massive market opportunity.”\n\nMultiverse Computing extends its sincere gratitude to its current investors for their continued trust and support, as well as to the European institutions whose backing has been instrumental in achieving this milestone.\n\nFor more information about Multiverse Computing and CompactifAI, visitmultiversecomputing.com.\n\n\n\nAbout Multiverse Computing\n\nMultiverse Computingis the leader in quantum-inspired AI model compression.

        "content": "Miriam Prieto - Expansión\n\nSpain's Multiverse Computing has made it into CB Insights' global ranking of the 100 emerging companies with the most potential, which identifies the projects set to lay the foundations for the next wave of innovation. Europe does not want to be a mere spectator in the race to lead in artificial intelligence, led by the United States and China.\n\n\n\nBeyond France's Mistral, several European start-ups are beginning to make their way onto the global map. The AI 100 report by CB Insights, which selects the most promising artificial intelligence companies of 2025, highlights twenty-three European projects for their innovation and potential in areas such as defense, infrastructure or security. Among them is the Spanish company Multiverse Computing, specialized in the development of quantum-inspired algorithms. In the previous edition of the ranking, the Valencian company Argilla, which has a platform for improving the quality of artificial intelligence data, was selected. This report does not focus on already consolidated start-ups, but seeks to identify “the companies that are building the foundations of the next wave of innovation in artificial intelligence”, explains Adya Pandey, an analyst at CB Insights, who points out that they have analyzed more than 17,000 companies around the world for the release of the report.\n\nTHE RISE OF MULTIVERSE\n\nMultiverse Computing is the only Spanish company to be included in a ranking that, in its European x-ray, is dominated by the United Kingdom, with a dozen companies included in this year's list. Stephanie Dalwin, an analyst at CBInsights, highlights the momentum that France is gaining as an innovation hub: “It is an emerging region on the global scene,” she says, pointing out the dominance of the United States in the global list, with 66 companies selected. France has placed five start-ups, followed by Germany, with four.\n\nMultiverse Computing, based in San Sebastian, develops advanced quantum algorithms. This startup, founded in 2019 by Enrique Lizaso, SamMugel and Román Orús, has created software based on quantum computing principles that makes it possible to optimize large artificial intelligence models by creating smaller and more efficient versions. Their technology makes it possible to reduce artificial intelligence models to 10% of their original size, thus maintaining the same level of performance but using fewer resources. This reduces energy consumption and computational requirements. It also facilitates their local use in devices such as cell phones and even virtual reality glasses or household appliances, capable of operating in offline mode.\n\nLast February, the Spanish government announced an investment of 67 million through Sepi digital in the company, which it sees as a candidate to become a unicorn, as unlisted companies with a valuation of more than 1 billion dollars are known. According to data collected by CB Insights, the valuation of the Spanish start-up amounts to $108 million.\n\nFRENCH POLE\n\nThe big European star of the previous edition of the ranking was Mistral, the French generative artificial intelligence laboratory. Founded in 2023, this start-up has succeeded in record time in becoming a world leader in language modeling. The company, already valued at nearly 6 billion euros, has raised 1 billion to date.This year, France has another unicorn on the CB Insights list: Poolside.This company, founded two years ago, has captured the market's attention with its artificial intelligence-assisted programming tools. With a valuation of $3 billion after raising $500 million last fall, Poolside has established itself as one of the most ambitious bets on the European continent. Another project of the Gallic hub is Zama, which develops solutions focused on privacy and data protection through artificial intelligence, with a valuation of 400 million euros.\n\nThe expansion of the French artificial intelligence ecosystem is part of a national strategy promoted by Emmanuel Macron. In February, the French president announced a 109 billion euro plan to turn the country into a global benchmark in artificial intelligence, with investments mainly in data centers led by private capital.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nEurope is also strengthening its strategic commitment in sensitive sectors such as defense. In fact, the most valuable company in this year's global ranking is the German defense technology startup Helsing, valued at $5.37 billion. Founded in 2021, it has risen rapidly thanks to the application of artificial intelligence for defense and security applications. Based in Munich, the company raised €450 million last summer in a round led by General Catalyst.In the United Kingdom, Wayve, which specializes in autonomous driving based on machine learning, stands out. This company led a historic round in Europe in 2024, raising more than one billion, at an undisclosed valuation, in an operation led by SoftBank, in which investors such as Nvidia and Microsoft participated.\n\nOther emerging projects show the diversity of artificial intelligence applications on the European continent. Norway's 1X develops humanoids for industrial environments; the UK's Aquan applies this technology to create agents for the financial sector; France's Bioptimus works in the life sciences, while Sweden's Embedl develops energy efficiency solutions.\n\nTRENDS\n\nThis year's report reflects some of the major global trends in artificial intelligence. For example, the advance of autonomous agents that complete tasks on behalf of the user. “Although many of them currently have human intervention, we expect a move towards solutions with greater autonomy,” explains Dalwin. This analyst also points to the rise of physical artificial intelligence integrated into robots and vehicles, the growth of companies with vertical solutions applied to sectors such as health, finance or defense, as well as opportunities for projects related to the security and governance of artificial intelligence, derived from its growing adoption.\n\nIN FIGURES\n\nThe CB Insights ranking looks for projects with potential and not yet consolidated. Last year's winners attracted $80 billion in funding after their selection.\n\nIn this year's edition, 23 European companies have been selected, with the United Kingdom dominating the list with ten companies, followed by France with five start-ups and Germany with four. There is one Spanish company, Multiverse Computing.\n\nEurope has two unicorns in the ranking: Helsing ($5.37 billion) and Poolside ($4.5 billion). The other seven that appear in the report are American.\n\n\n\nCheck the article here: https://www.expansion.com/economia-digital/companias/2025/05/01/68124825468aeb25768b457f.html"

        "content": "DONOSTIA, Spain, April 08, 2025  -- Multiverse Computing, the leader in AI model compression, today released two new AI compressed models by CompactifAI: 80% compressed versions ofLlama 3.1-8BandLlama 3.3-70B. Both models have 60% fewer parameters than the original models, 84% greater energy efficiency, 40% faster inference, and yield a 50% cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy. AI developers can immediately plug the models into any application – edge, on-premise, or cloud. Multiverse will release versions of the top LLMs compressed by CompactifAI over the coming months.\n\nCompactifAI is Multiverse's proprietary AI compressor. It is the first compressor of its kind, using quantum-inspired tensor networks to make AI systems more efficient and portable, reducing size up to 93% with only a 2-3% drop in accuracy—an astounding feat when compared to an industry-standard 20-30% accuracy loss with 50-60% compression techniques.\n\n“CompactifAI is changing the economics of AI processing and opening up new use cases for AI models,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, CEO of Multiverse Computing. “Efforts to curb unwieldy models have come up short. Our novel approach to compression grounded in quantum-inspired techniques makes it possible to pair performance with processing efficiency and gives us a massive edge on LLM providers.”\n\nMultiverse Computing was founded in 2019 by pioneers in quantum-inspired software to develop novel solutions to complex business problems. In 2023 the company began applying its core technology to address the AI energy crisis with CompactifAI.\n\nLLM providers have turned to techniques such as pruning and quantization to compress models but have yet to eradicate the tradeoff between size and performance. For instance, Llama3.1-8B Slim by CompactifAI requires 300x fewer training tokens than Meta’s CAI Llama3, and 3x fewer training tokens than Nvidia’s Llama3.1-Minitron while outperforming across benchmarks. For Llama3.3-70B Slim by CompactifAI, comparative benchmarks show an increase in reasoning capabilities while maintaining original precision.\n\n“We’re rapidly delivering compressed versions of the most powerful LLMs in the world,” said Sam Mugel, Chief Technology Officer at Multiverse. “The advanced capabilities of these two massive models can now fit into smartphones, laptops, and cars, or real-world machines like oil rigs and satellites. Our aggressive roadmap to roll out dozens of compressed, leading LLMs could dramatically accelerate the impact of AI in the real world.”\n\nLeading banks, telecommunication, and energy companies are beta users of the two compressed models. Llama3.1-8B Slim and Llama3.3-70B Slim are available via API in theCompactifAIplatform. For additional information on Llama3.1-8B Slim, performance benchmarks and pricing, seehere. For more information on Llama3.3-70B Slim, seehere.

        "date": "April 08, 2025",
        "content": "UNESCO declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, and both Google and Microsoft followed by demonstrating breakthroughs in quantum computing. Given DeepSeek's introduction in January of new methods for developing efficient AI models, 2025 also promises to be the year of AI efficiency.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, quantum computing companies worldwide raised $677.2 million in 30 deals in the first quarter of 2025, up from $426.1 million in 20 deals in the same quarter in 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, European startups accounted for 16.5% of the total funds raised by quantum computing companies worldwide. However, in the first quarter of 2025, Europe's share of worldwide VC investment in quantum computing has risen to 47.5%.\n\nRiding this European momentum, Donostia, Spain-based startup Multiverse Computing, which focuses on quantum AI software solutions, released two new AI compressed models today. Both are Llama models with 60% fewer parameters than the original models, 84% greater energy efficiency, and 40% faster inference, yielding a 50% cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nMultiverse uses quantum-inspired tensor networks to make large language models or LLMs more efficient and portable. It has raised $100 million and has more than 100 customers worldwide. Over the coming months, it plans to release compressed versions of the top 20 LLMs.\n\nAnother European startup,IQM, which sells a 54-qubit full-stack superconducting quantum computer, recently announced it will be integrated into one of the world’s fastest supercomputers in Bologna, Italy. The system will, among other applications, be used to optimize artificial intelligence quantum algorithms.\n\nLast year, AI attracted over $100 billion in funding, marking the highest funding year for the AI sector, with nearly a third of all global venture funding directed towards AI startups. Asked why he left the AI field to focus on quantum computing, Hartmut Neven, founder of Google's Quantum AI lab, answered, “Both will prove to be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced AI will significantly benefit from access to quantum computing.\"\n\nOn April 4, SandboxAQ announced it closed a $450 million Series E funding round, bringing its total capital raised to over $950 million since its 2022 spinout from Alphabet. SandboxAQ’s large quantitative models or LQMs, are a class of AI models trained on physics, chemistry, and mathematics rather than text or language. These models are designed to simulate and optimize physical systems, with applications in materials science, drug discovery, navigation, and finance.\n\nAt the GTC AI conference last month, AI leader Nvidia announced the establishment of the Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center. The Boston-based center aims to advance quantum computing research with accelerated computing, including integrating quantum processors with AI-based supercomputing to overcome significant challenges in the quantum computing space.\n\nFollowing this announcement,Quantum Machines, an Israeli startup providing quantum computing control solutions, announced it will work with Nvidia to integrate its Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips with QM’s advanced quantum control technologies, including the OPX1000. This integration will facilitate rapid, high-bandwidth communication between quantum processors and classical supercomputers. The collaboration between Quantum Machines and Nvidia aims to significantly accelerate practical applications of quantum computing by reducing latency and enhancing processing efficiency.\n\n‍Quantum computing “will not only upend digital security but spur investment, reshape industries, and spark innovation,” wrote MIT’s Jonathan Ruane, Andrew McAfee, and William D. Oliver in “Quantum Computing for Business Leaders” (Harvard Business Review, January-February 2022). They had more to say about practical quantum computing applications last Friday at the Business of Quantum Summit, organized by MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy.\n\nAmong other resources developed at MIT, summit attendees explored the Quantum Economic Advantage Calculator. This online tool models the business challenges best addressed by quantum computing based on efficiency and cost.\n\nThe emerging marriage of quantum and AI was also part of the discussion of quantum’s potential impact at the summit. Accenture’s Carl Dukatz observed: “As AI is evolving, there is more of a convergence between what quantum can offer to AI… as well as how AI is already accelerating quantum development.”\n\nCheck it out here: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2025/04/08/the-coming-convergence-of-ai-and-quantum-computing/"

        "content": "Sam Mugel, Ph.D., is the CTO ofMultiverse Computing, a global leader in developing value-driven quantum solutions for businesses.\n\nMuch like the march of time, deep technology progress can be invisible, especially if there are too few metrics to track and benchmark that progress.\n\nFor artificial intelligence (AI), the benchmarking issue is especially acute due to its 2023 baseline. That was the \"year of AI\" because of its transformative moment in terms of mainstream adoption, technological breakthroughs and public awareness. How do you track progress from such an explosive inflection point?\n\nSince then, AI’s progress has continued but has become more opaque, as Garrison Lovely explained in theTimemagazine article, \"Why AI Progress Is Increasingly Invisible.\" The article describes the media’s muted response to OpenAI’s o3. The model shows large gains on difficult, technical benchmarks in math, science and programming, but these gains are less visible to anyone not doing graduate-level science work.\n\nI did notice these significant improvements as well as the need to recognize and understand these milestones. The idea that the improvements in AI over the past year do not represent as large a leap in overall performance as the jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4 is incorrect. There are several advances that should not remain invisible.\n\nOne of the recent improvements in the model is its scaffolding, which boosts the AI model’s autonomy and capacity for interaction with the outside world. Better scaffolding can make AI much more competent and agentic, which is a model that can make decisions and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nThe ability to use tools and perform multi-step activities on behalf of a user can be granted to AI agents. Only recently has the AI industry turned its attention to implementing agents instead of passive chatbots. Progress has been made quickly.\n\nThe dark side of this progress is that as AI models become more intelligent, they become more adept at deceit. As they become smarter, they can better understand the purpose of their guidelines.\n\nA recent publication from Apollo Research, an AI safety firm, showed that the most advanced AI models may plot against their creators and users in specific circumstances. The systems occasionally tried to evade scrutiny, falsify alignment and conceal their actual capabilities when instructed to follow a specific goal.\n\nHere’s where explainable machine learning, or XAI, comes in. This design approach provides a capable intervention for humans to subsequently build safeguards. After all, one should be able to explainwhyan algorithm provides a particular answer. XAI aims to provide machine learning models that are clear and understandable to humans, in addition to being reliable and accurate. XAI (1) fosters trust and helps sound decision-making by clearly explaining results and (2) guarantees adherence to ever-tougher transparency laws.\n\nRecent work that uses tensor networks (TN) to implement XAI shows a capability to capture complex, statistical correlations. Inside of TNs, this work shows how a mathematical construct called matrix product states (MPS) can provide an efficient, explainable AI with an exceptional degree of interpretability. MPS bridges the gap between the abstract nature of high-dimensional data and the requirement for well-informed decision-making.\n\nAnother “invisible” AI advancement is improvements to the training of large language models (LLMs), which have a high cost and energy expenditure.\n\nA November 2024 report from Deloitte predicts that energy consumption from AI use will go from the current 382 terawatt hours (TWh) to 1,975 TWh in 2035 and up to 3,059 TWh in 2045 if adoption rates are high. To put this in perspective, one terawatt hour could power the entire U.S. for 2.5 days.\n\nThe continued development of these systems is unsustainable without significantly impacting the planet. That’s why compression schemes to reduce the data volumes are critical. In this context, compression techniques for LLMs have been suggested, with quantization, distillation, pruning and low-rank approximations being dominant and successful in practice.\n\nHowever, there is no compelling reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy. A more targeted compression approach that leverages advanced tensor networks shows more promise.\n\nThis tensorization effectively truncates the correlations present in the model, enabling a significant reduction in the memory size and number of parameters of the LLM model while maintaining accuracy. In practice, the compressed model requires less energy and memory, and operations such as training, retraining and inference become more efficient.\n\nThe significant reduction in the number of model parameters by tensorization drastically reduces the GPU-CPU transfer time, consequently reducing the training and inference time by 50% and 25%, respectively. Hence, this tensorization approach is particularly well-suited for distributed training of LLMs and for reducing the overall energy consumption of these models.\n\nIt’s true that there is a growing disconnect between the public perception of AI and its actual potential. It is up to us in the AI community to explain these developments and where this technology is headed."

        "content": "With the Euskadi Avanza awards, EL CORREO, Banco Sabadell and the Basque Government recognise the decisive contribution of entrepreneurs to the Basque Country. In this eighth edition, the winners are IMQ, one of our leading companies; Emiliano López Atxurra, a passionate about the industry with a European vocation; AJL Ophtlamic, a business initiative born from expert ophthalmologists; and Multiverse Computing, a novel project exploring the potential of quantum technology.\n\n\n\nSME of the Year Award AJL Ophthalmic\n\nSergio Llamas\n\nInnovation, firm development with feet firmly on the ground and a clear understanding of the needs of users. These are the three concepts that mark the evolution of AJL Ophthalmic, the business initiative that a group of ophthalmologists created in 1992 as a distributor of lenses, and which was immediately launched into its own production from Álava that reaches the entire globe.\n\nAlthough increasingly in the background, the company maintains its distribution role in Spain; a consolidated way to continue financing their developments and promoting research. Its objective is to solve the problems that experts have been detecting in almost all areas of vision, from valves to combat glaucoma to interventions on the optic nerve to restore vision to fire victims, or even membranes that help heal the wounds that dogs can suffer in their corneas.\n\n\"Our goal for the future is to continue opening up to markets. We already have 85 distributors around the world that allow us to get from Mexico to Afghanistan,\" says AJL's CEO, Pedro J. Salazar. He was given the task of developing this company that in its 33 years has made several giant leaps. Even so, Salazar defends that they have advanced with an intentional \"slowness\" that has helped them to maintain their stability at all times. \"We have not been excessively expansionist. Others might have grown faster, but here we have climbed each step well consolidated,\" he reflects.\n\nIts focus on research has also allowed AJL to explore different markets to maintain a constant evolution in a healthcare field very marked by high costs and the number of controls and certifications necessary to be able to develop its advances. Meanwhile, its trajectory has not stopped, setting new milestones such as the incorporation in 2007 of a business line focused on anaesthesia and the air tract, to the acquisition in 2013 of the US company Addition Technology Incorporation (ATI) to market intracorneal rings.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the inauguration almost 15 years ago of its 3,000 square metre facilities in Álava with specific areas for R+D+i. \"In this market we all know each other, from the large multinationals to the smallest companies, and in the sector they already know that we can develop many ideas with American doctors, European and anywhere in the world. They know us and come to us,\" Salazar summarises.\n\nManu Álvarez\n\nIf one day someone calls for a demonstration in favor of the industry, it is more than likely that he will be in the head and holding the banner. Now that everyone is talking about the 'Draghi report' and the need to invest in Europe to narrow the technological and industrial gap that has opened up on the continent, it seems easy. Doing so for decades, even when some voices were committed to influencing and putting the weight on the service sector, has more merit. Emiliano López Atxurra, the current president of Petronor, the company that is the main contributor to the public coffers in the Basque Country, shares his passion for industry with a European vocation. These are the two axes that have traced his training and also his professional dedication in recent decades.\n\nA graduate in Law from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, he completed a master's degree in international studies at the prestigious Institute of Political Studies in Paris, participated in the creation of some consulting companies and landed fully in the energy sector as a member of the board of directors of the company Gas Natural. In 2015 he assumed the presidency of the Basque company Petronor to replace the current CEO of the Repsol group, Josu Jon Imaz, and from that responsibility he has led not only some of the most important industrial investments of the moment in the Basque Country, but also the transformation process of a sector, the energy sector, which is bound to be a protagonist of decarbonisation.\n\nConvinced that we must move firmly towards the decarbonisation of mobility and also of industrial activities, López Atxurra has also been critical of a transition process that, due to excessive ambition and accelerated speed, could be lethal for European industry. In this context, he has always called for public officials to commit to technological neutrality. That is, by establishing a point of arrival without prefixing which path to take when there are several alternatives. Hence, the bets of the Basque company he presides over have now focused on looking for sustainable alternatives to oil, such as hydrogen and synthetic fuels, a commitment that could lead to the investment of hundreds of millions of euros in the next decade.\n\nHis sensitivity to innovation and technological development also led him to preside over the technology corporation Tecnalia between 2016 and 2020 and since 2021 he has been a member of the board of directors of the Repsol group.\n\n\n\nCompany of the Year Award IMQ\n\nM. Álvarez\n\nThat idea that he is one of the three indestructible pillars on which Biscayan society is based, along with Athletic and the Virgen de Begoña, is not something gratuitous or far from reality. IMQ, the Igualatorio Médico Quirúrgico, may seem to be the main exponent of private and elite medicine in our society but, in reality, the reasons that forged its birth were different, just the opposite of that stereotype: to guarantee quality health care to humble families, at a time when public health had not yet been structured, when private assistance was really expensive and many citizens were not covered by the sectoral mutual societies that had been created until then. Even in order to have access to the services of what we know today as IMQ, the maximum monthly salary that its associates could receive was limited, so that it was precisely the workers who were the main beneficiaries of health care.\n\nThe term 'Igualatorio', the vocation of 'equalising' the medical care to which all citizens could access, was precisely the basis of the philosophy that inspired the initiative of two local doctors, Vicente San Sebastián and Enrique Ocharan. Not only was it the first private healthcare organisation in Spain, but they were eight years ahead of the creation of the national health system. The evolution of both systems, the private and the public, has led them to coexist in our society as two complementary formulas to pursue the improvement of health and life expectancy in this society.\n\nToday, almost 91 years after its foundation, IMQ is a more complex and sophisticated group than its founders could envision, a true holding company that includes an insurance company with several branches of action and companies dedicated to the management of clinics, homes for the elderly, surveillance services and advice on occupational health. Despite this, it maintains the vocation of preserving differential elements with other similar companies with which it competes in the market, such as the management of its own clinics and, above all, the maintenance of family doctor care that act as the true capillary network of the organization.\n\nSince October 2023, the group has SegurCaixa-Adeslas as its majority shareholder, has 2,700 direct employees and around 390,000 customers in its insurance company.\n\n\n\nNobel Prize Multiverse Computing\n\nS. Llamas\n\nThe spirit of the Gipuzkoa-based company Multiverse Computing seems to inhabit a theoretical world, but its evolution is already based on a physical plane in which it has established itself as the largest quantum software company in the European Union.\n\nIts co-founder and CEO, Enrique Lizaso, explains that his team develops \"quantum computing solutions applied to real industry problems in sectors such as finance, manufacturing, energy, defence, chemicals, aerospace...\". The company manages to apply quantum algorithms through tools that also allow them to work on current computers, so they will not only make it possible to take advantage of the power of the chips of the future, but they already serve to \"optimize processes using quantum principles in conventional systems\".\n\nThus, its CompactifAI software is capable of compressing artificial intelligence models such as GPT, Llama or Mistral. \"Through this compression we managed to reduce the size of these models by 95%, thus achieving a drastic reduction in energy consumption and making these AI models much more affordable,\" he summarises.\n\nThe project was born in 2019 thanks to the vision of an interdisciplinary group – initially focused on the financial sector – that saw the potential of transferring quantum theory to current computing. They highlight the favourable environment that welcomes the company, thanks to \"solid institutional support\" in which BIC Gipuzkoa has played a decisive role, and an advanced scientific and technological ecosystem.\n\n\"Since our creation in 2019 we have experienced exponential growth, going from a small team to more than 150 employees of up to 35 nationalities,\" they detail. Strategic hiring and the attraction of researchers has allowed them to bring together \"talent\" capable of developing cutting-edge solutions that optimise the solution to specific problems in the industry \"such as the improvement of supply chains and industrial processes or advanced simulation in chemistry, materials or energy\".\n\nTo put the numbers to spare, the company has 72 patent applications for its quantum algorithms and artificial intelligence to be applied in sectors such as finance or manufacturing. These licenses reinforce their position as technology leaders \"and ensure the exclusivity\" of their solutions. \"AI and quantum computing are already redefining the present of companies,\" says Lizaso."

        "date": "December 19, 2024",
        "content": "DONOSTIA-SAN SEBASTIÁN, SPAIN – December 18, 2024 – AI and quantum company Multiverse Computing and the Bundesdruckerei Gmbh, the German federal government’s technology company, are exploring the potential of quantum and quantum-inspired solutions. The two companies recently completed two research projects that combined quantum-inspired software and data security expertise to build new prototypes that generate synthetic data more accurately than classic standard algorithms for machine learning. Together they investigated use cases such as improving privacy and utility of synthetic data generations as well as detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks.\n\nQuantum-inspired machine learning (QIML) provides an efficient and scalable approach by leveraging quantum theoretical principles such as tensor networks to manage large data sets and perform machine learning tasks more efficiently than classical techniques. One big advantage of these methods is their ability to compress and process data efficiently and accurately without losing critical information.\n\nIn the first project, the potential of a quantum-inspired algorithm for synthetic data generation was explored, with an emphasis on increasing privacy protections for sensitive data within large datasets. Synthetic data is crucial for providing accessible, scalable datasets while protecting privacy, reducing bias, and lowering costs. It enables model training when real data is limited or sensitive, making it a valuable tool in AI and simulation.\n\nThe teams started with a publicly available dataset and developed a synthetic data generation application based on a quantum-inspired AI model that incorporated differential privacy as an additional privacy layer to make the model resilient to adversarial attacks. The layer of protection added by differential privacy ensures that individual entries in a dataset cannot be reverse engineered by external or internal adversaries.\n\nData generated from this novel quantum-inspired software was compared to the results from a Generative Adversarial Network, a standard classical machine learning algorithm used to generate synthetic data. The quantum-inspired data generation model showed a 15% higher accuracy than the classical solution in generating synthetic data that closely matched the original data.\n\n“There’s no doubt that we will continue to see new ways that quantum solutions can make AI stronger and more efficient in the service of protecting people and data,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, CEO ofMultiverse Computing. “Our work with the team at Bundesdruckerei shows how to combine expertise of each technology leaders to explore the new generations of AI solutions by leveraging quantum and quantum inspired computing to raise the level of data privacy and cyber security.”\n\nThe other project focused on developing an AI solution to detect fraudulent transactions within a blockchain network using a quantum-inspired graph neural network and a quantum boosting machine learning algorithm. The results showed that the quantum-inspired approach achieved the same performance as the classical version while reducing AI Model-parameters significantly. This improved training time by 11% and inference time by 27%.\n\n“The research cooperation with Multiverse Computing is a great addition to our research activities in the field of quantum technologies. It is very important for us to work together with the leading quantum industry players to explore new AI solutions in the quantum age, in particular in the context of data privacy and cyber security,” said Dr. Kim Nguyen, Head of Innovations of Bundesdruckerei GmbH.\n\nAbout The Bundesdruckerei GroupBundesdruckerei GmbH and its subsidiary Maurer Electronics GmbH are driving technological developments in the areas of identity and authorisation management, administrative digitisation, data analysis and artificial intelligence as well as government payment methods and value transfer systems.

        "title": "Safeguarding Personal Privacy In The AI Era",
        "date": "October 17, 2024",
        "content": "Data privacy is an issue of growing concern in the wake of explosive advances in commercially available AI systems and applications. Trained on ever larger datasets, AI algorithms could enable the resolution of critical economic and societal problems. Yet it could also introduce some significant challenges related to the intended or unintended misuse of personal digital information. Is there a way to protect society from intrusive data collection or is online privacy a thing of the past?\n\n\n\nThe Nature Of Privacy Risks\n\nNavigating privacy in the AI era was the focus of a recent panel discussion I participated in at a forum put on by La French Tech Toronto.\n\nHistorically, privacy was often defined in terms of what was not shared or made public. As digitalization spreads to most aspects of our lives, privacy now focuses on securing consent and maintaining control over the flow of data related to our physical selves, and social, economic and political activities, as well as managing data spillover from individuals who aren’t the intended target. Consent over access to, storage and use of this personal information is one of the cornerstones of many regulatory and policy frameworks.\n\nNonetheless, some data-hungry machine learning algorithms are being trained with mined data obtained without our explicit consent or even awareness, which can have a variety of negative impacts. One risk of the unsanctioned collection and use of personal information is its use by repressive regimes that leverage data to create detailed records of movements and activities in order to target people. Used to impede the participation of certain persons in public life, this is known as model-enforcedrepression.\n\nAnother risk associated with the misuse of personal data is identity theft and targeted fraud. For example, deepfakes of a chief financial officer and other staff members at a Hong Kong-based multinational company were used to createan AI-generated videoconference. These re-creations were successful in persuading a key staff person to transfer $25 million to a bank account set up by the fraudsters.\n\n\n\nThe Benefits Of Personal Data Sharing\n\nDo the risks associated with the misuse of personal information mean we should curtail all use of private data? Absolutely not. While there are definable risks, sharing data has enormous benefits at all levels of society.\n\nFor example, access to data about driving behavior de-risks the operation of vehicles and lowers insurance premiums. This is the approach behind Tesla drivers’ Safety Scores, used to manage eligibility and determine Tesla Insurance rates. By incentivizing better driving, personalized data collection has also reduced long-term accident rates.\n\nThe sharing of data offers commercial benefits for customers and businesses. It is a growing necessity for online commercial activity, as demonstrated clearly when Alibaba deactivated its personalization features. This was shown to drive down click-through rates and product browsing, resulting in an81% dropin buying rates. On the consumer side, sharing more granular data offers more tailored shopping experiences, which can ultimately improve competition and pricing.\n\nData sharing also saves lives. With some of the most stringent data protection laws in the world, Europe is seeing anestimated50,000 avoidable deaths each year related solely to constraints on patient information sharing, which limits monitoring that could directly reduce neonatal mortality rates or better identify and treat HIV patients. That doesn’t even account for the exponential improvement in outcomes if data was used to train evidence-based AI medical models.\n\nRegulatory approaches are tackling some of the issues related to data flows in an effort to improve privacy and control over personal data security. The EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation requiresexplicit permissionfor the collection, storage and processing of personal data. The California Privacy Protection Agency has proposed regulations requiring data transparency by companies and allowing consumers toopt outof data collection.\n\nWhile most frameworks offer certain protections,expertsare nonetheless concerned about the downsides of stringent regulatory frameworks. They advocate interventions such as proportional taxation of the data collected by companies.\n\n\n\nAI-Generated Solutions To Improving Personal Data Protection\n\nSome protections against privacy breaches have already been generated by AI itself.Googleused a common technique to blur faces and license plates, called enforced filters, in Google Street View, a technique also being relied upon byChatGPT. The problem with enforced filters is that workarounds can secure access to forbidden information from models.\n\nConsequently, the tech sector is turning to more innovative AI-generated approaches. One of them is synthetic data generation, a technique being explored in Spain, where patient data is not allowed to be transferred outside of hospitals.\n\nHere, my company is exploring ways to train AI on the country’s entire inventory of original personal data so that it contains the statistical data relevant to the original training data without the threat of divulging identifiable personal information. This requires that we build a dataset of realistic patient data where none of the patients actually exist.\n\nAnother AI technique designed to secure personal data is to selectively delete information that could compromise privacy, a process akin to what happens in the filmEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Currently, this technique poses some risk of harming training. It also needs to be certifiable so that it can hold up in court.\n\nSo we are devising techniques that avoid the need to completely retrain models, a process that involvestensorizingfully trained large language models and then removing the connections associated with certain information in a way that does not impact other useful information.\n\n\n\nAI-Generated Solutions To Privacy Concerns\n\nMachine learning is starting to drive some incredible benefits to society. It is critical to maintain the flow of data-driven innovations, which risk being stymied by overly cumbersome and unnecessarily restrictive regulatory frameworks. Yet there is a clear need to address privacy concerns.\n\nLet us use the same drive and human ingenuity propelling advances in AI to create more of the tools that can safeguard against the misuse of data and protect the informational privacy rights of everyone.\n\n\n\nCheck the article here:Safeguarding Personal Privacy In The AI Era (forbes.com)"

Insostenibles, en primer lugar, por su consumo energético. Hoy sabemos ya que, para entrenar y ejecutar modelos de IA, se debe multiplicar por cuatro las necesidades de cómputo cada año. El último modelo de frontera de Meta, Llama 3, ha requerido 16.000 GPU de Nvidia, cada una de las cuales demanda 1,7 kilovatios, lo que nos da 27 MW de potencia total.En ese sentido, la cuántica toma posiciones.Multiverse Computing se inspira en física de materiales avanzados y puede hacer desaparecer el 70% de los parámetros de una red neuronal y reducir la memoria en un 93%, con un impacto en la precisión del modelo de apenas el 2%.

        "date": "August 29, 2024",
        "content": "Professor Román Orúshad been exploring the intricacies of tensor networks since his postdoc days. His latest work as the Chief Scientific Officer atMultiverse Computingcombines that expertise with a deep knowledge of quantum mechanics to make machine learning algorithms more compact, efficient and portable.\n\nIn 2006, Román was the first in Spain to write adoctoral thesis on the topic of quantum algorithms. After finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Barcelona, he continued his work at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, with a focus on tensor networks. There, he wrotean introduction to tensor networksin 2013, which has since received over 2,000 citations. A quickYouTube search for “Román Orús”returns a long list of results, including atensor networks lecture at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, aninterview at QUANTUMatter 2024, and adiscussion of quantum application developmenton The Superposition Guy’s podcast.\n\nRomán has anextensive library of peer-reviewed published researchand even has a patent in the works related to his work infermionic tensor machine learning for quantum chemistry.\n\nTensor Networks are efficient mathematical representations of complex data structures. These representations illustrate how variables in a system are related to each other. Román recently demonstrated how tensor networks are a natural tool to describe and improve the efficiency of the machine learning structures behind Large Language Models like ChatGPT. Multiverse’sCompactifAIuses tensor networks to provide significant savings on energy and compute costs.\n\nIn this Q&A, Román explains why tensor networks caught his attention initially and how he expects this branch of mathematics to continue to influence the future of technology.\n\nWhen/why did you first start researching tensor networks?\n\nMy first interaction with tensor networks happened while I was doing my Ph.D. in Barcelona. By then, around 2004,Guifre Vidal(then at Caltech, now at Google Quantum AI) had published a paper on how to simulate a quantum computer using a particular mathematical structure which, in the end, happened to be a specific type of tensor network. At roughly the same time,Ignacio Cirac’sgroup at The Max Planck Institute started to investigate similar topics. Our department in Barcelona had a lot of interaction with all of them, and towards the end of my Ph.D. thesis, I started to implement some of these ideas in my own work. I was fascinated from the beginning, and after my Ph.D., I moved to Australia to work with Guifre as a postdoc fully in the development of these (in those days) new methods.\n\nWhat makes this technique so powerful?\n\nTensor Networks efficiently describe complicated data structures, such as high-dimensional operators and vectors. This representation can also be manipulated with relative ease and, what is more interesting, makes explicit the structure of correlations. In physics, it was discovered that tensor networks are the natural language to describe many important phenomena, including complex quantum states of matter, quantum computers and even the fundamental structure of space-time itself. Beyond physics, it was also recently discovered that they are the natural tool to describe machine learning structures and improve all their computational bottlenecks. This allows, for instance, the improvement of the efficiency of Large Language Models, such as those behind ChatGPT.\n\nWhat is the biggest misconception about tensor networks?\n\nPeople coming from the machine learning community, without a physics background, tend to believe that “tensor networks” are similar to “tensor flow” or “network algorithms.” They are wrong. Tensor networks are a completely different concept; they are mathematical tools that allow the efficient description and manipulation of complicated structures. Moreover, people tend to believe that some very basic tensor network algorithms (such as those based on something called “Matrix Product States”) are everything that the field has to offer. They are also very wrong, since the number of methods and techniques is huge and can be adapted and tailored almost to any problem. The issue, however, is that few people in the world have deep knowledge of the variety of these methods and how powerful they can actually be.\n\nWhat are future use cases for tensor networks that you’d like to research?\n\nI would love to fully explore the synergies between tensor networks and machine learning. As such, AI is called to change the world as we know it, and we see it already with generative AI, LLMs and all their applications. The problem is that the methods behind them are inefficient: it is not how Nature works! I believe part of the solution to this problem is tensor networks. We need to reformulate AI entirely in this language, which will make AI efficient, powerful and explainable. In my opinion, tensor networks are not just interesting mathematical tricks, but a technological revolution by themselves.\n\nWhat has been your most impactful contribution to the field?\n\nThis is hard to measure, and I am definitely not the best person to say which is my most impactful contribution. But, looking in perspective, I believe that the application of tensor networks to compress Large Language Models has, and will have, a very deep impact. After all, we showed that most of the information content in LLMs is redundant, and this is something that will have direct implications in our everyday life, especially considering the boom of generative AI. Moreover, I also love to see how these methods, originally developed in the context of quantum physics, are now making the jump to everyday tech, which is something that I could not foresee when I started working in the field and inventing some of the algorithms that we are now using."

        "title": "Iberdrola and Multiverse Computing Announce Pilot Project Success to Optimize Battery Installation in the Grid",
        "date": "July 11, 2024",
        "content": "Iberdrola, one of the world’s largest clean energy companies, andMultiverse Computing, a global leader in value-based quantum computing solutions, have successfully delivered a pilot project in northern Spain to optimize the installation of grid-scale batteries, which will become increasingly important as the energy transition progresses.As electricity grids are integrating increasing amounts of renewable generation, electric vehicles, heat pumps and other distributed energy resources, battery storage is providing an increasingly important service to ensure grid stability. Multiverse Computing’s solution uses quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms to select the optimal number, type and locations of batteries on the grid network. This reduces the costs of adding batteries to the grid and increases network performance.i-DE, Iberdrola’s distribution company in Spain, oversaw the pilot project, which was focused on Guipuzkoa’s electricity grid (Basque Country, Spain). During the ten-month pilot, quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms matched or outperformed classical benchmarks to maximize grid reliability and voltage control.The project was developed as part of Iberdrola’sGlobal Smart Grids Innovation Huband part of the Gipuzkoa Quantum Program.“With the power of quantum computing, private and public institutions can meet sustainability goals while saving on both fixed and variable costs,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, CEO of Multiverse Computing. “We are proud to support the development of more reliable and economical green energy in Spain alongside a world-leading clean energy provider like Iberdrola.”Estibaliz Goñi, Process and Technology director of i-DE, also stated, “The results of this pilot project are encouraging, and we will continue exploring the deployment of this technology. There are many challenges to overcome to ensure we have the smart and robust grids required to deliver the energy transition, and innovations like this will help us get there.”According to a recent report by the IEA, meeting climate goals will require adding or refurbishing 80 million kilometers (~50 million miles) of electricity grids by 2040 – the equivalent of the entire existing global grid. Another report by the same agency showed that the investment ratio between renewables and networks has been imbalanced for the past years. Meanwhile, the investment ratio between renewables and grids was $1.00 to $0.40. To achieve climate goals, that ratio must be adjusted to 1:1, at minimum.The ProjectTo achieve the pilot’s goal, the 10-month project used a quantum annealer and classical hardware to test the optimization solution. This algorithm was tested in grids of different sizes, exploring this solution first on small-scale grids and then in larger ones, such as Gipuzkoa’s grid.To address the need for more resilient and cost-effective electric grids, Multiverse Computing and Iberdrola implemented quantum and quantum-inspired solutions to achieve improvements in grid batteries across three key areas:- Initial cost: Optimize the cost of buying and installing multiple batteries in the electrical grid.- Voltage control: Maximize the capacity of maintaining voltage levels in the nodes of the grid.- Reliability: Minimize the impact to customers of power outages in the grid.The project team used Singularity, Multiverse Computing’s platform for quantum and quantum-inspired software, to optimize the network. Quantum-inspired techniques use insights and mathematical models from quantum physics to develop better classical algorithms. The tool enables users without experience in quantum computing to utilize quantum optimizations to boost the speed and accuracy of solutions for complex problems in the energy sector and other industries.The PartnershipsThis pilot was developed under the umbrella of Iberdrola’s Global Smart Grids Innovation Hub. This innovative space, located in Bilbao, is a world-class center for innovation and knowledge in smart grids. The Hub serves as a collaborative platform, bringing together Iberdrola’s technological expertise with over 100 partner entities and companies. The Hub focuses on addressing the challenges of the energy transition, including digitalization, data management, and adaptability to new consumption models like electric mobility and self-consumption. Its mission is to lead the energy transition by fostering talent and accelerating innovation in smart grids.The project, initially announced in 2023, is also part of the Gipuzkoa Quantum Program in the Basque Country of Spain, a quantum computing hub and smart grid innovation center, offers financial incentives for collaborations between quantum startups and potential customers.About IberdrolaIberdrola, Europe’s largest electricity utility by market capitalization and one of the world's top three electricity companies, is a leader in renewables, spearheading the energy transition to a low carbon economy. The group supplies energy to almost 100 million people in dozens of countries. With a focus on renewable energy, smart networks and smart solutions for customers, Iberdrola’s main markets include Europe (Spain, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France, Germany, Italy and Greece), the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Australia.

        "content": "Multiverse Computing, a global leader in AI and quantum software solutions, won time on a supercomputer to build a large language model (LLM) for the Large AI Grand Challenge by AI-BOOST, an open challenge program designed to be a benchmark for the European artificial intelligence (AI) community.\n\nAI-BOOST, funded by the European Commission, awarded Multiverse Computing 800,000 hours of compute time on a supercomputer to build and train an LLM from scratch using quantum and quantum-inspired technology.\n\n“Winning this challenge recognizes the specific strength of Multiverse Computing in building faster and more energy-efficient LLMs by using quantum and quantum-inspired technology, today,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, co-founder and CEO. “We are proud of the confidence EU leaders have in our expertise and ability to create a new class of LLMs with faster training, smaller datasets and lower operating costs.”\n\nThe teams awarded in the Large AI Grand Challenge will have 12 months to develop a large-scale AI model with a minimum of 30 billion parameters and train it on one of Europe’s supercomputers.\n\nThis award also represents a significative step-up of the efforts of the European Commission to apply quantum and quantum-inspired technology to the AI field, and in particular to LLMs. The Quantum AI field is getting more and more attention as it is perceived as a potential solution to the increasing demand for larger computational and energy resources in AI.\n\nMultiverse Computing’s new CompactifAI software uses quantum-inspired techniques to make LLMs 95% smaller and 50% cheaper to train and run, while preserving high levels of accuracy.New research from the Multiverse Computing science teamcompared CompactifAI’s performance to commonly used compression techniques and found that CompactifAI removes unnecessary elements of the model while still producing all the same fine detailed performance.\n\nAs the paper explains, CompactifAI reduces the number of parameters in a model by 70 to 80%, and cuts memory requirements by 95% or more. This significant reduction speeds up both the training process and inference time by at least half. All these changes result in an accuracy drop of only 2%. At a time when regular LLMs are costing $100M or more to train, these savings show a clear path to make the LLMs both cheaper and more environmentally friendly.\n\n“Our recent benchmarking paper shows that our software significantly reduced the size of a large language model with 7 billion parameters,” said Román Orús, Chief Scientific Officer of Multiverse Computing. “We’re excited to rise to the challenge of using our quantum-inspired techniques as we develop a model from scratch. We also have detailed plans to use near-term quantum computers to accelerate the LLM training process even more.”\n\nThe winners of the Large AI Grand Challenge will also have the opportunity to work with the European Commission’s AI and Robotics Group and the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking.\n\nChallenge applicants submitted a detailed project plan for the development of a large-scale AI model from scratch, a justification for the use of HPC, and a demonstration of the team’s expertise in training foundation models using HPC systems.\n\nThe overall objective of AI-BOOST is to attract talent from all over the EU and Associated Countries to drive scientific progress in AI. The project will foster collaboration between the key stakeholders in the AI community to define attractive AI challenges with the potential to lead trustworthy and human-centric real-world solutions.\n\n\n\nAbout Multiverse Computing\n\nMultiverse Computingis a leading AI and quantum software platform dedicated to applying quantum and quantum-inspired AI solutions to address complex challenges in finance, energy, manufacturing, logistics, space, life sciences, healthcare and defence, delivering tangible value today.\n\nLeveraging expertise in quantum and quantum-inspired AI algorithms, the company maximizes results from both current quantum devices and classical high-performance computers.

        "content": "The transformative power ofLarge Language Models(LLMs) like ChatGPT and Meta’s LLaMA for applications in artificial intelligence and data analytics comes with high development and operational costs. Building these models canrequire as much as $5 millionper training run to meet the immense compute and energy demands of the thousands of GPUs that handle massive datasets in parallel. Complexity, bias and lack of explainability also cause problems once the models are deployed. These barriers put significant limitations on what we can do with today’s AI models.\n\nThese enormous energy bills are only going up: analysts predict thattraining costs will double every year for the forseeable future.\n\nTo reach the next level, AI must do more with less.\n\nMultiverse Computing has built a tool for conducting AI “surgery” to trim excess weight while keeping the models just as accurate and powerful, proving that bigger isn’t always better.\n\n“Our results imply that standard LLMs are, in fact, heavily overparametrized, and do not need to be large at all,” said Román Orús, Chief Scientific Officer of Multiverse Computing.\n\nOrús is one of the authors of a new paper from Multiverse Computing that explains how tensor-networks can compress AI models without losing accuracy. Therecent paper, “CompactifAI: Extreme Compression of Large Language Models using Quantum-Inspired Tensor Network,” demonstrates how CompactifAI uses quantum-inspiredtensor networksto shrink these models.\n\nThe paper also includes benchmarking data to illustrate CompactifAI’s performance.\n\nAs the paper explains, CompactifAI reduces the number of parameters in a model by 70% to 80%. This significant reduction speeds up both the training process and inference time: cutting memory requirements by 93%, training time by 50% andinferencetime by 25%. All these changes result in an accuracy drop of only 2%.\n\nMultiverse’s compressor CompactifAI uses this process to shrink AI models:\n\nOrús and his team evaluated CompactifAI’s performance by compressing META’s LlaMA-2 7B model. After the model was compressed and healed, it was benchmarked on tasks related to language understanding, reasoning, reading comprehension, world knowledge and math (see Table I in the paper).\n\nWhile reducing the parameters by 70%, the model maintained 98% of the original accuracy, surpassing the results of other compression techniques and suggesting that a substantial portion of parameters in LLMs are unnecessary.\n\nTensorization significantly reduces the number of parameters, while retaining the most relevantcorrelationsbetween parameters. This reduction means fewer parameters are transferred during the model’smulti-GPU distributed training, drastically reducing the GPU-CPU transfer time.\n\nAs a result, the tensorization approach achieves a 50% speedup over the original and purely quantized models trained on the same amount of data.\n\nThese methods also allow refined layer sensitivity profiling, showing that deeper layers tend to be ineffective for LLM performance and more suitable for tensor network compression.\n\n“CompactifAI’s tensor network compression provides a much more refined, controllable, and explainable compression technique of LLMs compared to alternative methods,” said Orús. “Our approach is also versatile and can be implemented alongside other compression methods like quantization, distillation and pruning.”\n\nQuantization reduces memory size but slows inference by 13%. However, by combining quantization and tensorization, this approach results in a 93% reduction in the memory size of LlaMA-2 7B while speeding up inference by 25%.\n\nCompactifAI reduces the overall number of parameters in a model, which means a smaller number of parameters can be transferred much faster between CPU and GPUs. This results in energy saving.\n\n“Our technique can also be deployed on premises without the need of a cloud connection, opening the door to smaller, personalized LLMs,” Orús said. “With CompactifAI, AI models use less energy and memory while training, retraining, and inference all become more efficient.”"

        "title": "Big AIs in Small Devices",
        "date": "June 17, 2024",
        "content": "Only a few years ago, artificial intelligence (AI) was dominated by rather small, tailored models, each designed for a singular purpose. Now, a massive transformation is occurring. These models are increasing in size on a daily basis. Powered by neural networks, they are turning into more general AI models capable of undertaking a multitude of tasks. To build those models and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more data, and more and more computational resources are required. AI models are demanding enormous computational resources [1] to train and simply to use them.\n\nRunning concurrently with the AI revolution is the ever-growing emergence of IoT and edge devices. IoT devices collect data for processing and edge devices perform the processing. This network of physical devices, from everyday household items to industrial equipment, are working with limited resources, particularly when it comes to memory and computational power. AI models can leverage the high volume of data these devices collect but not in their current form.\n\nEnabling LLMs for the edge\n\nConsider a modern-day factory equipped with automated production lines. If equipped with IoT and edge devices, these machines also can self-diagnose issues, predict maintenance needs, and adapt in real-time to changes in the production schedule or design.\n\nWhat if this production line could utilize AI to detect in real time microscopic defects [2], and allow the machinery to adjust its operations instantaneously? High-resolution cameras connected to processing units can execute such sophisticated tasks by leveraging the power of large AI models. In this case, computer vision models analyzing images in real time are known to be resource-intensive. Yet, the embedded systems running the production line (the edge devices in this scenario) are constrained in terms of computational capacity and memory. These devices need to be compact to fit within the machinery, robust to withstand the factory conditions, and responsive to maintain production efficiency.\n\nThe dilemma emerges: How do we equip a factory production line, bound by its inherent limitations, with the capabilities of expansive AI models that can transform it into a dynamic, adaptable and highly efficient manufacturing process?\n\nThe potential solution\n\nThe solution may lie in the quantum realm. Indeed, quantum computing carries a lot of promise when it comes to computational bottlenecks. Within the context of IoT, the potential applications of quantum computing are vast. However, given the current state of quantum hardware, these computations are only possible with cloud-based platforms, accessing quantum hardware through the internet. The reason lies in the inherent challenges associated with quantum systems. In the context of IoT and edge devices, where compactness and real-time computations are necessary, the current quantum hardware simply doesn’t fit.\n\nWhile true quantum computation on edge is clearly out of reach for now, quantum-inspired algorithms offer a feasible alternative. These algorithms, run on classical hardware, offer a computational advantage compared to their classical counterparts. For the immediate future of edge computing, quantum-inspired methods might just be the bridge between the quantum promise and our classical reality.\n\nThe power of tensor networks\n\nThe most promising quantum-inspired approach for edge computing use cases relies on tensor networks.\n\nOriginating from the realm of quantum physics [3], tensor networks are attracting increasing attention in the domain of deep learning and AI. A tensor network is a framework to represent complex, multi-dimensional information efficiently. These networks can decompose high-dimensional information into smaller, more manageable components. In the process, they capture the essential information while discarding redundancies.\n\nTensor networks work well with neural networks, which are at the heart of many AI models.\n\nNeural networks, particularly deep ones, can contain billions of parameters. These parameters often contain a lot of non-essential information, which increases memory and computational demands. Tensor networks provide a way to represent these vast networks using fewer parameters, compressing the model without significantly compromising its accuracy [4].\n\nWhen it comes to integrating tensor networks with large AI models based on neural networks, two main approaches can be considered:\n\nModel Compression:The AI model is compressed after its training using tensor decomposition techniques. This approach allows for significant size reduction while retaining most of the model’s performance.\n\nTensorized Layers:The AI model is constructed using tensor networks, and then trained with tensorized architecture. This approach also allows for significant size reduction, retains model performance and could improve training performance as well.\n\nRecent experiments with these methods have shown promising outcomes, achieving model compression that significantly reduces the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude [5], thus creating models that are more suitable for edge computing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs IoT devices that aim to collect more and more information to feed big AI models, those models in turn must work within the limited resources of edge devices. Large language models, which are leading the advances of natural language processing, exemplify this challenge.\n\nIn this landscape, tensor networks emerge as potential candidates to remove this limit. By leveraging tensor networks, it’s possible to compress the massive architectures of LLMs without diluting their proficiency and make them manageable in embedded systems.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Pope, R., et al.

        "content": "No matter how brilliant the application, commercializing quantum technologies and reaching scale in a nascent market requires enormous resources. Quantum startups are having to find and develop a list of paying customers at a time when R&D costs still outweigh revenues by a significant ratio and margins are extremely tight.\n\nAs with most maturing technology markets, access to capital is critical to resolving these barriers to scaling. The anticipated growth of the emerging quantum marketplace—projectedto be worth $106 billion by 2040—continues to buoy investor interest. Private investorschanneled$1.5 billion (mostly through SPACs) into quantum startups in 2023 alone, while cumulative public sector investment to date has exceeded an estimated $38 billion globally.\n\nThose public funds have done a great job in providing the capital needed to develop startup talent and technology. It has even been the main driver for disruptive R&D in some regions. Yet as the ecosystem starts to consolidate, and funding rounds get larger, it is becoming clear that public investment schemes need to turn their attention to the pain points faced specifically during the transition to scaleup. One of the most significant challenges is access to annual recurring revenue (ARR).\n\nGovernments and funding agencies should look to the province of Gipuzkoa in northeastern Spain, where the government is addressing this particular challenge with a novel approach to public investment: It is offering financial incentives for collaborations between quantum startups and potential customers.\n\nGovernment investment programs provide essential capital for equity and R&D. And as previouslydiscussed, we know that current funding schemes have their limitations—including, for example, a reluctance by a government to take on the lead investor role. These funding schemes unfortunately don’t always create companies that are attractive to investors. Most notably, they completely overlook the role of ARR in scaling. By funding B2B sales (with provisions for required R&D), governments can actually improve the rate of startup success—at no extra cost to the public purse.\n\nThe Gipuzkoa government’s program is designed to incentivize local companies to partner with quantum startups by mitigating their commercial risk. Its program creates those commercial relationships that are so essential for startups in generating AAR, providing that essential proof of market performance and a robust incentive for mid-to-late-stage investment.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Gipuzkoa government’sQuantum Programpays established, local industrial companies to collaborate with startups for the purposes of industrial research and the development of commercial quantum products and services.\n\nThe program funds much-needed collaboration between quantum startups and end users in the development and real-world deployment of commercial applications. It creates a completely new vector for scaling, one based on building B2B relationships. And by laying thegroundworkfor sales, the subsidies help generate the ARR that will attract the venture capital funding needed for startups to scale.\n\nAnother of the program’s benefits is that it places quantum solutions into the hands of industrial users, ensuring an extremely short R&D feedback cycle. This approach is markedly different from the approach of many players in the ecosystem, like IBM Q and AWS Bracket, which target users mainly from academia or corporations’ innovation departments.\n\nOn a broader level, the program is an investment in the entire value chain for quantum technology. Not only does it validate and encourage engagements with technology providers by potential local and regional business customers, but it also strengthens vital local talent pools.\n\nGovernment funding typically injects capital used for equity and R&D. It provides the liquidity particularly needed in deep tech fields like quantum technology, with its long R&D horizons. Increasing liquidity is, however, not the primary challenge for post-revenue companies looking to grow their revenues and attract late-stage investment.\n\nWhat the Gipuzkoa program gets right is that it subsidizes the development of B2B relationships that will drive repeated and scalable product sales. As an added value, the impacts of every dollar of investment will ripple beyond paying for local salaries and work their way through the entire local or regional value chain. These benefits will mount up without spending a dollar more of scarce public resources.\n\nBuilding a support structure for product sales is only one policy tool available to public funding institutions. Yet the subsidies have been so successful in Gipuzkoa that governments elsewhere are likely to adopt similar funding schemes. By helping create the commercial traction needed to scale operations and generate ARR, governments will be taking concrete action toward protecting the economic and strategic values of the maturing quantum ecosystem in which they have already invested so much public capital.\n\nPublsihed inForbes Technology Council"

But it’s not yet clear what that architecture will look like and especially who will build it. Check out all the insights below.\n\nMeantime, in the usual yin-yang of late, investors keep piling more money into AI startups — and even established companies are benefiting, as Oracle, UiPath and Foxconn all beat estimates thanks to AI spending — but meantime, governments seem determined to rein it all in.\n\nIn fact, they seem inclined to rein in a wide variety of tech companies, led by the House’s bill that could lead to TikTok getting sold or even banned — though the Senate seems less enamored of the idea.\n\nOne more thing: Despite some signs of uncertainty lately, some companies in the other perennially hot market — cybersecurity — some companies are managing to keep pulling ahead, including CrowdStrike, Wiz and Zscaler.\n\nLate-breaking Friday:It looks like HashiCorp may be up for sale, Bloombergreported.

        "content": "Technology’s evolution is often a permutation of several existing combinations. One of those pairings in today’s computing environment is artificial intelligence and quantum computing, with the latter supplying efficiency and reduced resource usage.\n\nAt the forefront of this intersection is quantum computing software company Multiverse Computing S.L.\n\n“The real idea was, OK, we have AI systems that are expensive to train — they are large and so on, and could we just prepare something that is not only smaller, because you have to fit the system somewhere, but also consumes less energy,” saidEnrique Lizaso(pictured), co-founder and chief executive officer of Multiverse Computing. “We analyzed the problem and said, ‘Yes, this is a particular problem that fits into quantum computing.’ Then, at some point … somebody inside the company suggested, ‘OK, we have done that in the manufacturing line … can we apply that to LLMs?'”\n\nLizaso spoke with theCUBE Research principal analystRob Strechayat the“Supercloud 6: AI Innovators” event, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the transformative potential of harnessing AI and quantum computing to streamline industrial and enterprise operations.\n\nOften seen as trailing behind tech giants such as the United States and China, Europe is now asserting its presence in the quantum and AI domains. Multiverse Computing’s recent successfulfunding roundhighlights the continent’s commitment to pushing boundaries in these fields.\n\nThe company’s ethos sheds light on the potential for quantum-inspired techniques to reshape industries beyond the realm of tech giants. From defect detection in manufacturing to real-time patient monitoring in healthcare and injury prediction in sports, the applications are vast and transformative, according to Lizaso. The core principle, however, remains constant: making AI more accurate, efficient and cost-effective.\n\n“I think that two days ago, there was some news in the Financial Times about Iran using 20% of the electricity production just for data centers,” Lizaso said. “The demand for new data centers and also for more performance from the data centers is escalating super fast. So, they say, ‘OK, we have to apply the data centers to use green energy.’ [But] the AI electricity consumption is escalating so fast that even if you put all the resources of green electricity you have now, you are not going to cope with the demand.”\n\nA pressing concern in AI deployment is the integrity of models, particularly in scenarios such as customer service where misinformation can have severe consequences. Multiverse Computing’s upcoming solution promises to address this by enabling models to selectively forget information, mitigating the need for costly retraining due to data errors or privacy violations, according to Lizaso.\n\n“We thought that, OK, those quantum techniques make a representation of the distribution of the knowledge inside a [large language model],” he said. “From a different point of view, I mean the systems authorization … you can just extract, eliminate some parts of information with more precision. This is super important — [our new solution] is going to appear in the next months. So, it’s not only about compressing and making cheap things cheaper, but also to do that.”\n\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE Research’s coverage of the“Supercloud 6: AI Innovators” event:"

Governments have committed over $40 billion over the next 10 years globally according to Lakestar’sState of Quantum 2024report. The analysis showed that countries must catalyze growth by fostering quantum ecosystems, supporting homegrown talent, and enabling domestic startups to access the growth capital they need.\n\nEnrique Lizaso-Olmos, CEO of Multiverse Computing, discussed the state of European quantum and AI development with Rob Strechay as part of the Supercloud 6 event hosted bytheCUBEby SiliconANGLE.\n\n“Europe has the feeling that we are losing the tech race to the U.S. and China again and again,” Lizaso said. “We need to be working harder and bolder in a variety of fields to catch up, particularly in both quantum and AI. This is a good time for Multiverse Computing as we work at the intersection of these fields.”\n\nNations across Europe have accepted this challenge. TheUK’s National Quantum computing Centerwill open this year, aiming to promote cross-sector quantum collaboration to boost the UK economy.The VTT Technical Research Center of Finlandhas announced a national strategy to build quantum hardware with 54 qubits by the end of 2024, focusing on micro and nanotechnology. In Switzerland,Quantum Baselfocuses on Industry 4.0 and pharma, offering access to IBM Quantum’s platform and IonQ’s quantum computer.House of Quantum in Delftis a collaborative hub for quantum development, expanding access to cryogenic quantum computing. France isseeing returns on its $1.9 billion national quantum strategyand Germany isspending $3.3 billion on quantum techand aiming to have a 100-qubit machine by 2026.\n\nMultiverse recently won a project with the German Aerospace Center’s DLR Quantum Computing Initiative to use quantum simulation to improve the reflectivity capabilities of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Multiverse will work with Single Quantum, a Dutch company that specializes in photon detection hardware, on this effort.\n\nEuropean leaders have taken notice of Multiverse’s accomplishments.The European Innovation Council’s Scaling Club just named Multiverse as one of the highest potential deep-tech scaleups in the EU. Last month the company won the Future Unicorn Award from DigitalEurope in Brussels, delivered by the EU Commissioner Iliana Ivanova, for its potential to reach a $1 billion valuation due to its work on large language models with quantum-inspired technologies.\n\nMultiverse also just announced an oversubscribed $27 million Series B funding round that includes plans to expand into more industries and to develop more quantum-inspired software.\n\nThe Quantum-AI Intersection\n\nMultiverse’s approach involves creating “green algorithms” using quantum-inspired techniques to address the escalating energy consumption of AI, which is becoming increasingly relevant with the rising demand for AI applications.\n\nIn his conversation with Strechay, Lizaso explained that these versatile techniques can be applied across manufacturing, healthcare, and sports analytics, to solve specific problems like defect detection, patient outcome prediction and injury prediction. It was during a collaboration with Bosch that Multiverse researchers realized that tensor networks applied for machine learning and simulation in manufacturing could also be applied to LLMs.\n\nWe discovered that techniques from quantum computing, such as tensor networks, can be applied to classical computing problems, leading to significant improvements in efficiency and performance,” Lizaso said. “Our first applications saw over 85% reduction in size, and more than doubling the speed in both training and inference time. We are really confident that we can push these figures farther.”\n\nBy combining quantum techniques with artificial intelligence, Multiverse aims to provide solutions that are smaller, faster, and cheaper, with a particular focus on training large AI models more efficiently.\n\nCompactifAI, Multiverse’s solution for the high compute cost of LLM’s, uses tensor networks to reduce the number of parameters in a model, reducing its overall size as well as shrinking memory and storage space requirements.\n\n“This new tool needs to be implemented now by companies who want to make AI more sustainable,” Lizaso said. “Our customers can use the ability to compress large AI models to ease the challenges of deployment by saving on development costs and energy requirements across training, general operations and retraining.”\n\nThe Future Quantum-Enhanced LLMs\n\nAs Multiverse builds more quantum-inspired techniques for AI, the company plans to release a solution that addresses concerns about detecting and removing bad data in large language models (LLMs). Retraining models initially trained with data that is bad or IP-protected is expensive.\n\n“This Lobotomizer makes LLM’s forget, enabling the precise extraction and elimination of undesirable information without retraining the entire model,” Lizaso said.\n\nAs quantum and quantum-inspired techniques work alongside classical techniques to further improve compression and reduce the cost of training AI models, LLM applications will become more accessible.\n\n“Our work with quantum AI techniques is democratizing the field by making AI more affordable, faster, and efficient, leading to increased competition and innovation,” Lizaso said. “As our technology rapidly advances in step with the technology hubs and government programs across Europe, we believe the European quantum-AI ecosystem will rival those of the U.S. and China.”"

        "title": "2024 Poised to Be a Pivotal Year for Quantum Technologies",
        "date": "April 02, 2024",
        "content": "Among the most exhilarating developments is the emergence of quantum-inspired advancements in artificial intelligence, including those that make large language models smaller and more efficient. Quantum-inspired AI promises to revolutionize the way we approach ChatGPT, LLaMA and other generative AI. By significantly reducing their size without compromising accuracy, quantum-inspired AI not only enhances efficiency but also ensures compatibility with various compression methods.\n\nMoreover, we should see the advent of hybrid quantum machine-learning techniques that combine the best of quantum and classical technologies, operated on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This fusion is expected to expand the accessibility of AI, enabling its on-premises deployment and unveiling an uncharted market brimming with opportunities. Can you imagine running ChatGPT on your smartwatch without access to the cloud? This could happen in 2024.\n\nThe hardware front is set to witness substantial progress this year, building on the milestones achieved in 2023, such as IBM’s achievement of 1,121 superconducting qubits and QuERA Computing’s development of 48 logical qubits using neutral atoms.\n\nGoogle also reported a quantum advantage experiment last year that successfully completed a random circuit sampling calculation using a 70-qubit quantum computer, claiming the same task would have taken 47 years on a classical computer.\n\nMoving beyond Google’s quantum advantage benchmark, the hardware focus is shifting toward three critical areas: error mitigation, quantum error correction and scalability. These endeavors aim to construct deeper and more precise quantum circuits while safeguarding computations and eventually scaling the technology to support millions of error-corrected qubits.\n\nThe journey toward scalability, though challenging, is expected to advance this year with pioneering experiments. In this respect, 2024 may be a key year for hardware development beyond NISQ computers.\n\nIn particular, we expect to see the first quantum computers connected via quantum channels and working together as a unified quantum processor. Why build a 1,000-qubit processor if we can construct ten 100-qubit machines and connect them quantumly? The tricky part here will not only be the quantum communication but also the quality of the individual processors. Therefore, we anticipate significant advances in error mitigation for quantum processors at the 100-qubit mark. As for quantum error correction, we expect to witness the first quantum codes functioning for more than 100 qubits.\n\nAs the venture capital investment landscape undergoes a transformative resurgence, the quantum sector is witnessing a significant uptick in investor interest, with rising valuations for quantum startups and an increase in the number of deals being finalized. This activity is fueled by a broader revival in deep-tech investments, with quantum technology and AI at the forefront.\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between quantum technology and AI suggests that a surge in AI investments, spurred by the advancements in generative AI, will concurrently drive increased investments and higher valuations in the quantum domain. As such, 2024 is poised to be a year in which capital flows generously into quantum and other deep tech, bolstering innovation and development. We expect to see big checks going to quantum companies this year.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning the efforts being made in quantum investments through public funding, exemplified by recent initiatives in Germany, England and South Korea. We expect 2024 to bring many more public funding efforts, which will fuel the development of quantum technologies and leverage the release of more private funds into the ecosystem. After all, investors are starting to see business value in early quantum industry solutions—for example, in AI and optimization.\n\nLast but not least, the current geopolitical situation is expected to lead to a boost in applications of quantum technologies in defense, along with the consequent associated investments.\n\nThis promises to be the year when quantum technologies transcend the hype and make tangible strides toward integration into everyday life. The synergy among quantum-inspired AI developments, hardware advancements and the influx of venture capital investment forms a robust foundation for this transformation.\n\nAs a quantum scientist and entrepreneur, I am filled with optimism about the prospects for these technologies, not just as abstract concepts but as practical tools that will redefine our interaction with the digital world. Let’s embrace this journey with open minds, ready to explore the possibilities that quantum technologies hold. After all, dreaming is the first step toward achieving the unimaginable.\n\n\n\nBy @roman Orus, co founder & CSO - EETimes\n\n"

        "title": "Researchers develop quantum-inspired algorithm that improves cyber attack detection and opens AI’s ‘black box’",
        "date": "March 27, 2024",
        "content": "SAN SEBASTIÁN, SPAIN, March 26, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Researchers fromMultiverse Computing, a global leader in value-based quantum computing solutions, and CounterCraft, global leaders in deception-powered threat intelligence, have built a new quantum AI model that significantly improves attack detection over traditional methods. Trained on datasets from actual network traffic and system logs, the Matrix Product State (MPS) model identified 100% of attacks.The MPS methodology employs adversary-generated threat intelligence instead of traditional rule-based systems to identify cyberattacks. This approach provides improved interpretability and clear insights into anomalies identified by the algorithm. Continuously advancing this model and enhancing its interpretability capabilities will pave the way for its real-world application in the near future, according to the researchers.CounterCraft analysts had already identified the attacks within the training data, which provided a benchmark for evaluating the performance of Multiverse’s new model. The model is described in a new paper submitted to arXiv: “Tensor Networks for Explainable Machine Learning in Cybersecurity.”\n\nThe model excels in reducing false positives with greater precision as compared to the majority of classical models, including isolation forest, one-class SVM and variational encoders. At the same time, the MPS model improved the explainability of the algorithm’s results, an increasingly important capability for business users and regulators, according to the researchers.“Explainable AI supports robust decision-making by providing clear explanations for outcomes, while improving understanding of threats and ensuring compliance with increasingly stringent transparency regulations,” said Roman Orus, Chief Scientific Officer at Multiverse Computing and an author of the paper. “Our work with CounterCraft shows how quantum techniques can strengthen cybersecurity defenses against today’s threats and future ones while improving explainability.”A cyber attack is generally not a single event but a series of 20-80 individual events. The MPS model identified 83.5% of these steps as well as finding several steps missed in the classical analysis.The training data for this model from CounterCraft contained detailed incident reports covering various attack types, such as weak credential usage and exploits of known vulnerabilities. The model was trained to tell the difference between normal behavior and abnormal behavior, enabling it to identify attacks.“We provide total visibility into an attackers' tactics and techniques to help customers anticipate and understand the strategies used by cyber adversaries, and this new model based on tensor networks will improve those capabilities,” said David Barroso, CounterCraft CTO and co-founder. “The ability to detect unknown attacks both inside and outside the network is vital for early detection and response and is one of CounterCraft's strengths.”The model also creates synthetic data which can be used for training models and to simulate activity for deception strategies.The software also includes a user-friendly risk tolerance slider so security analysts can adjust the sensitivity of the threat detection to their requirements. This ensures a high detection rate with a manageable number of alerts.This work lays the foundation for future research in cybersecurity and quantum software. Next steps for the research could include robust testing to enhance the model’s effectiveness in diverse scenarios. The initial use case was cybersecurity, but this model can enhance anomaly detection across finance, healthcare, government, critical infrastructure, manufacturing and retail.About CounterCraftCounterCraft is a leading provider of deception-powered threat intelligence solutions that empower organizations to proactively defend against cyber threats.

        "date": "March 20, 2024",
        "content": "Cuántos países darían lo que fuera por tener undream teamcomo el español en puestos clave de frontera de las tecnologías cuánticas. Darío Gil en IBM, Sergio Boixo en Google, Ignacio Cirac en el Max Planck, Antía Lamas Linares en Amazon Web Services, Ignacio Latorre al frente de los programas de Singapur y Dubái… por supuesto, Pablo Jarillo en el MIT.\n\nAhí lo tenemos, Pescanova ha encontrado la fórmula óptima para alimentar a sus gambas con computación cuántica de la mano de Fujitsu, uno de los pilares delhubde Galicia, con Carlos Cordero en el cuadro de control. Multiverse Computing, premio Future Unicorn 2024 de DigitalEurope, roza el centenar de patentes, con Roman Orús como gran atractor de talento.\n\nCellnex Telecom ha participado en la primera conexión con criptografía cuántica con tecnología propia en lo que será la futura red metropolitana en Barcelona y la prevista infraestructura paneuropea de comunicaciones cuánticas (EuroQCI), en una iniciativa promovida por el ICFO. E Hispasat lidera las pruebas para distribuir llaves cuánticas satelitales en el proyecto Caramuel.Lo cual, que los primeros estertores de la segunda revolución cuántica aterrizan ya en la economía real española, y no sólo a través del programa CUCO en el que están presentes Santander, BBVA o Repsol. Al Ibex no le queda otra.\n\nY luego está el fenómeno de La Palma, en Canarias, cuyo idilio con el premio Nobel de Física Anton Zellinger la ha situado, como en las mejores películas de Hitchcock en el centro de una compleja trama geopolítica que conviene desarrollar. Zellinger se encumbró tras demostrar el entrelazamiento cuántico de dos partículas ubicadas una en Tenerife y la otra en La Palma, sede del mayor telescopio óptico del mundo, en el Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos.\n\nEl hallazgo prueba que la modificación de una de ellas altera exactamente igual a su par, con independencia de la distancia que las separe. Tras el experimento de Canarias, se ha repetido la prueba entre Pekín y Viena, entre Pekín y Shanghái, y entre Pekín y el espacio. Siempre funciona. La idea a finales de la pasada década era seguir avanzando en las investigaciones sobre distribución de llaves cuánticas satelitales Pekín-La Palma, pero no llegó a materializarse.\n\nAhí es donde está el asunto. ¿Por qué tanta China en los trabajos de Zellinger? Uno de sus grandes discípulos (hijos de tesis los llaman) es Jian-Wei Pan, a quien se atribuye el liderazgo de la estrategia cuántica de su país desde la Universidad de Ciencia y Tecnología de China. Tendría a su disposición a miles de expertos (se habla en el sector de 15.000), lo cual ha puesto en guardia a Estados Unidos y a la OTAN en pleno.\n\nEntrevisté a Zellinger hace unos meses y casi se mofó del temor extendido acerca de la posibilidad de que estemos cerca de la inevitable supremacía cuántica, una de cuyas manifestaciones sería la ruptura de los actuales modelos matemáticos de criptografía y el inicio de una nueva era de seguridad basada en la física… por supuesto, cuántica.\n\nBásicamente, se trata de utilizar el sistema de entrelazamiento de partículas como llave. “El problema es que la velocidad de los datos es todavía muy, muy baja, sólo del orden de 1 KB por segundo, o tal vez 1 mega”, me dijo al referirse a sus experimentos. “Esto significa que un internet cuántico está muy, muy lejos. Una comunicación segura, sólo puede concebirse para una persona que habla, no mucho más”.\n\n“Es un problema porque nadie sabe cómo resolverlo”, justo en ese momento fue cuando sentí que se reía de las cautelas occidentales. “La discusión sobre la supremacía es una muy buena manera de obtener dinero del Gobierno. Es una muy buena historia periodística. Lo bueno es que hay muchos jóvenes inteligentes trabajando en esto. Pero, ¿prometer tecnología? Yo no lo haría”. A Estados Unidos, los juegos de Zellinger no le hacen ninguna gracia.\n\nEl hecho es que España tiene mentes brillantes desperdigadas por todo el mundo, el fenómeno de La Palma y también, cómo no, el caos autonómico habitual en ordenadores cuánticos. ¿Cuatro? Sí, uno en Galicia, otro en San Sebastián (un vicepresidente mundial del IBM es de la tierra y claro) y dos en Barcelona. Y ojo que Madrid y Andalucía se están preguntando por qué no tienen uno propio. Alguna tecnológica lista sabrá convencerles de que lo necesitan, pese a que, salvo el Ibex, apenas una decena de empresas lo demanda aún.\n\nEl Gobierno central tiene un programa estratégico sobre tecnologías cuánticas en la mesa que no sale a la luz. Se ha planteado una red cuántica de datos con punto de partida en el ICFO, que pase por Madrid (en El Pardo hay un nodo de llaves cuánticas), continúe por Vigo y llegue a Portugal.\n\nMás allá de las palabras están los hechos. En los últimos tiempos, es evidente la preocupación por preparar a todo aquel susceptible de ser atacado por la quiebra del cifrado, especialmente a las empresas vinculadas a sectores estratégicos, sensibles para Defensa. En Telefónica (telecomunicaciones), GMV (movilidad y aeroespacial) o Fujitsu (sanidad y sector público), el tema ha pasado a ser prioritario.\n\nPor cierto, que el misterioso idilio de La Palma con la élite de la física mundial no se limita a Zellinger, qué va. Fíjate que Stephen Hawking tenía como hijo de tesis a Garic Israelian, a quien se le ocurrió montar en la isla un festival llamado Starmus, al que acudieron desde Neil Armstrong al propio Hawking. ¿Quién ponía la música? Nada menos que a Brian May, el astrofísico guitarrista de Queen. En temas cuánticos, hay que reconocerlo: lo que pasa en La Palma, se queda en La Palma."

        "title": "The Quest for Transparency: How Quantum-inspired Tensor Networks Can Revolutionize AI Explainability",
        "date": "February 22, 2024",
        "content": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pivotal movement towards demystifying the decisions made by AI models, aiming to make these models not only precise and powerful but also transparent and understandable. This push for XAI is driven by the need to foster trust in AI systems by elucidating their decision-making processes and ensuring they meet increasing demands for regulatory compliance.\n\nTechniques such as LIME (Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) and SHAP (Shaply additive explanations) have been developed to bridge the gap between model accuracy and explainability. However, despite these advancements, many deep learning methods remain largely opaque, creating a challenge for achieving true interpretability.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Multiverse Computing introduces its groundbreaking Matrix Product State (MPS) model. Unlike conventional AI models that often act as “black boxes,” this tensor-network generative model offers a “white box” approach. This model not only achieves performance on par with the best available models but also provides incomparable interpretability.\n\nThe MPS becomes a new standard of transparency, with its functions and tensors offering clear, interpretable probabilities instead of uninterpretable weights. This breakthrough is pivotal for tasks demanding a high degree of trust and understanding in the AI’s decision-making process, such as in finance, healthcare, and legal fields.\n\nOur Solution and How It Works\n\nLeveraging Adversary-Generated Threat Intelligence, our approach transcends conventional rule-based systems. Rule-based systems use specific guidance to identify threats and explain categorizations of threats in terms of which rules were applied. In contrast, the MPS solution represents knowledge within the model’s tensor network structure, enabling a probabilistic understanding that captures complex correlations that are challenging to express using simple rules. It excels in learning ‘normal’ behavior patterns, which allows for the precise flagging of ‘abnormal’ activities, advancing significantly beyond traditional rule-based systems.\n\nThe model’s ability to identify unknown attacks is anchored in its proficiency in understanding the data’s probability distribution and contextual correlations. The Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) metric is pivotal here, quantifying how divergent an event is from the expected norm — the higher the NLL, the more anomalous the event. Moreover, this tool offers two pivotal capabilities:\n\n1. Synthetic Data Generation: At times, real-world data may be insufficient or too generic to effectively train models or simulate complex scenarios. MPS addresses this by generating synthetic data that mimics real-world complexities, enhancing model training and offering a strategic advantage in cybersecurity through the simulation of deceptive activities to thwart attackers.\n\n2. User-Friendly Risk Tolerance Analysis: The integration of our analysis tool allows for real-time monitoring and filtering of data by anomaly levels. This facilitates a focus on significant threats, optimizing resource allocation and response times.\n\nThis multifaceted strategy ensures a balanced alert system, minimizing false positives while providing deep insights into anomaly detection. The advanced interpretability of MPS, alongside its synthetic data generation capabilities, marks a significant leap forward in understanding complex AI decisions.\n\nThe training dataset for this model comprised 674,704 events, of which 1,007 were incident-related. This realistic imbalance poses a unique challenge, underscoring the need for a robust anomaly detection system capable of discerning subtle patterns of cyber-threats within predominantly benign data traffic.\n\nExpanding Explainability with Tensor Networks\n\nThe model’s interpretability includes direct probability extraction andvon Neumann entropy analysis, but its true strength is in its capacity to transparently reveal the correlations learned from data. It employs mutual information within the MPS framework to highlight feature interdependencies, as demonstrated through mutual information heatmaps. This approach not only makes the model’s decision-making process transparent but also streamlines its performance by aligning correlated features. Organizing these interdependent attributes within the data in a more straightforward structure makes interpretation easier and improves efficiency. This is particularly beneficial in sectors where understanding the rationale behind AI’s decisions is as crucial as the results, enhancing data representation and simplifying complex correlations for better interpretability and efficiency.\n\nThe Impact of Improved Explainability\n\nThe success of the MPS model in cybersecurity underscores its potential across various industries. By capturing the probability distribution and inherent correlations within data, the model showcases its adaptability, promising significant benefits in fields requiring transparent AI solutions. In the business realm, the necessity for explainable AI becomes apparent in scenarios like credit scoring and healthcare decision-making.\n\nFor instance, in credit scoring, the ability to elucidate the reasoning behind decisions aids in refining risk models and ensuring equitable practices. Similarly, in healthcare, explainability supports the interpretation of diagnostic models, fostering trust and enabling actionable insights. These examples underscore the broader applicability of MPS across various domains, where transparency not only builds confidence but also ensures compliance and operational efficacy.\n\nSetting New Benchmarks in AI Transparency\n\nThe quantum-inspired MPS model heralds a new era in machine learning, where the identification of threats and patterns is accompanied by clear, understandable logic. This paradigm shift towards explainable AI not only meets the current demand for transparency but also enhances the capability to generate synthetic data, thereby improving the training of complex models. As we continue to navigate the intricacies of AI applications, the advancements presented in “Tensor Networks for Explainable Machine Learning in Cybersecurity” (available on arXiv) offer a promising path toward more interpretable and reliable AI systems across various industries."

        "content": "What do you think are the biggest challenges facing data scientists/AI experts/quantitative practitioners/portfolio managers for 2023 and beyond?\n\nData abundance will continue to be an opportunity and a challenge. This trend will only increase now that we have powerful tools for generating content. What’s more, synthetically generated data will tend to reinforce the patterns that generated it in training new models, making realistic training and the prevention of hallucinations more complex. This is where you really need advanced techniques like Tensor Networks to eliminate redundancy and improve model performance. This also massively reduces training costs, which are set to become prohibitively expensive by 2026.\n\nWith Gen.Ai [gen.ai] being the word on everyone's lips and vigorous debate about the impact it has and will have on financial markets – do you think that it will seismically change the landscape or will it just automate the ‘boring stuff’\n\nThe spreadsheet was a revolution in that it made organising data free. The internet made knowledge sharing free. Gen.Ai is making content creation free. Even more important for financial markets, it makes vectorizing content free, meaning you can now gain insights from data we used to need a human to interpret. This is important because (1) a machine can sieve through massive volumes of data and act on insights and correlations real time, meaning there’s a significant speed advantage; and (2) Large Language Models can assist humans in interpreting complex, bringing untrained humans’ performance almost to the level of experts for many tasks, which has a profound impact on talent abundance.\n\nText data seems to be an area where firms are focusing, are there particular risks to this and how would you go about extracting the most value?\n\nFast textual analysis is exciting because it opens the doors to sentiment analysis driven trading. It introduces many challenges because you need to work with live data and respond in an extremely short time-frame while maintaining query privacy. We simply don’t have the hardware to support this volume of inference. That is unless we are able to considerably speed up inference and reduce the memory footprint of Large Language Models. This is exactly what we are achieving with our product CompactifAI.\n\nAre you seeing quant investing being used in new geographies/ asset classes /where are you expecting some interesting quant stories to be emerging from?\n\nNew methods are emerging to price asset classes which were intractable until now, like Bermudian swaptions. We’ve seen this for instance with neural networks, which far outperform traditional methods for exotic options pricing and hedging. Being able to efficiently and accurately price and calculate the Greeks for such complex asset classes will open up new markets and improve economic resiliency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Making Large Language Models Work On The Edge",
        "date": "February 02, 2024",
        "content": "Large language models like ChatGPT have revolutionized content creation. From writing code to offering nuanced, human-like conversations through customer service chatbots, businesses are now able to generate personalized content using foundation models trained on tens of billions of words. This evolving relationship with textual and visual data is fueling a new generation of potential custom solutions based on machine learning (ML) and requiring ever larger amounts of computing power and time.\n\nWith the cost of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) exploding, however, price is rapidly becoming a barrier to training new generative AI applications. Privacy is another roadblock: Training on public cloud-hosting platforms deters its adoption by potential customers in certain sectors.\n\nThese issues are driving the demand for new technologies to solve these problems and allow the continued development of LLM-generated business products. One answer to this problem is coming from quantum-inspired algorithms that resolve many of the issues constraining the use of ML on local devices.\n\nLLMs are trained with billions of parameters in massive language datasets. The weights of trained models, the hundreds of gigs of required memory and the rising prices of electricity and semiconductors make these models an incredibly resource-intensive area of ML. In fact, these generative models are becoming prohibitively expensive to train, rapidly limiting the accessibility of LLMs to all but the biggest enterprises.\n\nAlso, cloud-hosted LLMs are currently the norm in most industries, yet this convenient access is counteracted by some of the disadvantages. Cloud-hosted training models are subject to intermittent connectivity problems and latency. Training via the cloud introduces other major concerns such as the privacy of proprietary information and the sovereignty of training data. Cloud-hosted LLMs are also limiting for enterprises that want to train or run LLMs on-premises or on edge devices.\n\nOnce developed within the next five to 10 years, the full potential of quantum computing will revolutionize computational capacity in ways that completely transform our relationships with machines. In the interim, however, tensorizing neural networks is a bridging technology. It introduces new options for enterprises struggling with the resources needed for ML on LLMs on the edge.\n\nTensorizing neural networks is a quantum-inspired solution that uses a data structure derived from quantum physics. Neural networks have enormous numbers of nodes, with significant redundancy built into the structure. Tensors rid these networks of this redundancy without discarding its benefits. Restructuring the data results in a smaller model that can be trained faster on classical computers without the need for more hardware.\n\nLLMs on the edge have many applications across a range of sectors. For example, defense agencies and contractors require security for sensitive data, necessitating training with local servers. In the financial sector, traders training models for sentiment analysis don’t want sensitive information or data leaked to competitors. To capture changes in sentiment reflected in news reports or social media channels, they also require models that run very quickly. Tensorizing neural networks enable rapid and repeated running of models on local devices without risking the capture of proprietary data or its use in training foundation models.\n\nAnother example of the value of localized training involves businesses in which connectivity is an issue. This is relevant to remote resource operations, such as mines or oil and gas installations, that depend on reliable real-time connections to convey vital safety and operational information. Self-driving vehicles could make good use of complex LLMs, but not if those models need a guaranteed connection to a server at all times, as connections to the cloud can be impacted while driving through tunnels or in remote locations.\n\nOverall, ML provides an incredible opportunity to solve complex equations underlying many business problems—yet a paradigm shift is required. Until the advent of fully fault-tolerant quantum computing hardware, tensorizing the massive neural networks used to train and fine-tune LLMs offers a solution to simulating only the meaningful parts of a system without losing accuracy.\n\nWhile still a new technique, it is an exciting approach for enterprises looking to surmount exorbitant costs, maintain the privacy of their data and use LLMs on the edge.\n\nFull articlehere"

        "date": "February 01, 2024",
        "content": "“Aunque se pueda aprovechar el conocimiento generado en la experiencia con otros combustibles, como por ejemplo el gas natural, las propiedades diferenciales del hidrógeno (por ejemplo, es una molécula más pequeña, de menor densidad energética o con mayor potencial de degradación), hoy en día no permiten introducir el hidrógeno como combustible rentable y seguro en las instalaciones del sistema energético actual”, explicaron desde el proyecto. ONTZHi se propone superar estos desafíos mediante la investigación en cuatro líneas de trabajo clave: tanques y componentes metálicos (para uso estacionario), tanques para vehículos ligeros, tuberías de distribución y nuevos métodos de caracterización avanzados.\n\nEntre los desafíos actuales para el almacenamiento y transporte del H2 destacan “la resistencia de los materiales, el elevado peso de los tanques, el margen de seguridad de los sistemas, su elevado coste, la necesidad de aumentar la sostenibilidad o el escaso conocimiento sobre los límites de los materiales metálicos en la interacción con el hidrogeno. Asimismo, a temperatura ambiente el H2 es un gas extremadamente ligero y para tener una masa significativa dentro de un volumen razonable requiere de almacenamiento a alta presión, con las dificultades que esto conlleva”.\n\nONTZHi busca reducir el espesor de la pared de los tanques, mejorar la resistencia mecánica de los materiales, reducir costos, desarrollar tanques reciclables y con baja permeación al hidrógeno, y aumentar la eficiencia y sostenibilidad de los tanques, entre otros objetivos, según indicaron desde la iniciativa.\n\nEl consorcio está formado por siete entidades: cuatro centros tecnológicos,Tecnalia(coordinador),Cidetec,GaikeryTekniker; dos unidades de I+D empresariales,Multiverse ComputingyPetronor Innovación; y elCluster de Energía.\n\nEl consorcio cuenta además con el apoyo de siete entidades vascas que forman parte del Comité Asesor: Ampo, ingeniería experta en la manipulación de fluidos, en múltiples sectores, especialmente en las condiciones más extremas; Fluytec, ingeniería de desarrollo de productos de filtración; Innomat Coatings (Estalki corporation XXI), experto en recubrimientos superficiales; MLC ITS, Cluster de Movilidad y Logística de Euskadi; Protec Arisawa, especialista en recipientes a presión de plástico reforzado con fibra para sistemas de filtración por membrana; Tubos Reunidos, experto en soluciones tubulares innovadoras y sostenibles; Ulma Forge, proveedores y fabricantes de suministros industriales especializados en bridas y accesorios forjados.\n\nEl proyecto ONTZHi, financiado por el Departamento de Desarrollo Económico, Sostenibilidad y Medio Ambiente del Gobierno Vasco, culminará con el desarrollo de dos demostradores a escala de laboratorio: uno para recubrimientos de barrera de hidrógeno y otro para tanques de composites reciclables. Además, se creará al menos un modelo computacional para definir y desarrollar métodos de caracterización simplificados."

        "date": "December 30, 2023",
        "content": "2023 observations“Quantum advantage, the elusive goal of quantum computing, has been claimed by several companies and researchers in 2023 but these claims are based on very narrow and artificial problems that have no practical relevance or value. What we really need is practical quantum advantage, which means solving problems that matter for science, industry, and society, using quantum devices that are feasible and affordable in terms of size, weight, power consumption, and cost.” –Ilyas Khan, Founder and Chief Product Officer, Quantinuum“In 2023, we saw the growth of the quantum computing ecosystem, with more players entering the field and more collaborations forming across academia, industry, and government. The U.S. Department of Energy announced $625 million in funding for five new Quantum Information Science Research Centers. These initiatives reflect the increasing interest and investment in quantum computing around the world.” –Raj Hazra, President and Chief Executive Officer, Quantinuum“In 2023, academic and business organizations worldwide actively constructed quantum communications networks, spanning from a few miles to over a hundred miles in size. Research teams in places such as Chicago, Brooklyn, N.Y., and Hefei, China, diligently worked on various components required to establish this groundbreaking communications network. In June 2023, Terra Quantum achieved a groundbreaking feat in quantum communication: a new world record for both the speed of quantum data transmission and the distance covered. Using a fiber-optic network, the team successfully sent quantum-encrypted data over an impressive 1,032 kilometers (640 miles) and surpassed the previous record of generating secure, ready-to-use quantum keys by over 10,000 times.” –Florian Neukart, Chief Product Officer, Terra QuantumPredictions for 2024“Quantum hardware may start becoming more ready for industry-wide applications, thanks to powerful error-mitigation techniques and scalability experiments. Also, artificial intelligence will get a dramatic boost thanks to quantum-inspired methods, which will bring further memory efficiency, speed and accuracy. Multiverse is a pioneer in these techniques and will continue to develop quantum applications for large language models.” –Prof. Román Orús, PhD, Cofounder and Chief Scientific Officer, Multiverse Computing“In 2024, we expect to see more adoption and integration of quantum technologies in real-world scenarios, as well as more collaboration and standardization among different stakeholders. We also anticipate more challenges and opportunities arising from the coexistence of classical and quantum systems, such as interoperability, compatibility, and security.” –Raj Hazra, President and CEO, Quantinuum“In 2024, I think we’ll see a shift away from the focus on the qubit race and a broader perspective on the ability of quantum computing to expand the capabilities of other technologies. In the next 12 months, quantum hardware companies will achieve even closer integrations between classical and quantum hardware and software to achieve the highest performance from each technology. It will also be increasingly clear that quantum computing is the gateway towards artificial general intelligence based on quantum mechanics’ non-local, non-causal, and non-deterministic nature.” –Markus Pflitsch, CEO and Founder, Terra Quantum\n\n“In the upcoming year, I anticipate quantum computing will continue to present a growing concern for companies. But more importantly, next year businesses must evaluate their data and determine what information is of real value, to start transitioning into post-quantum cryptography as soon as possible.” –Toni Pesonen, Head of IT and Cyber Security at IQM Quantum Computers\n\n“Looking ahead to 2024, it is unlikely that we will see significant breakthroughs in the field of quantum cybersecurity, particularly with regards to code breaking. Nevertheless, the shift towards quantum-safe encryption will require a significant investment of time and resources, and it is essential to ensure the security of sensitive data in the long term. This presents an opportunity for organisations and institutions to focus on educating themselves and adapting their encryption systems to become quantum safe. In terms of other security applications, there may be more use cases identified for fraud detection using quantum computing.\n\n“While progress in quantum cybersecurity may be slow, there are other areas where we are closer to achieving quantum advantage. One such area is machine learning, where quantum computing can provide significant speedups for complex problems. We are already seeing this being tested in projects such as process optimisation in production. Another area where quantum computing is showing promise is in the simulation of chemical problems. This is already being applied in projects such as battery development.\n\n“As we move into 2024, we can expect to see more proof-of-concept use cases being published and a wider adoption of quantum computing in various industries. This will require collaboration between end-users and quantum experts to identify use cases and develop solutions that leverage the unique capabilities of quantum computing. Overall, while progress in these areas takes time, the potential benefits of quantum computing make it an exciting and promising field to watch in the coming years.” —Dr. Jan Goetz, Cofounder and CEO at IQM\n\n\n\nFrom Theory to Reality: The Quantum Potential\n\nQuantum technology allows us to harness the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are extremely challenging or impossible today.

        "content": "What is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum computing is an advanced field of computer science, physics, and mathematics that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to process and manipulate information at an accelerated pace.\n\nThis remarkable field encompasses both hardware exploration and application development, pushing the boundaries of computational capabilities.\n\nFor instance,IBM Quantumis a pioneering company that has made quantum hardware a reality, making it accessible to hundreds of thousands of developers. This achievement represents a remarkable milestone, considering that the idea of real quantum processors seemed like a distant dream just thirty years ago.\n\nDistinguished by their ability to leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and quantum interference, quantum computers excel in solving specific problem types more efficiently than their classical counterparts.\n\nHow Do Quantum Computers Work?\n\nThe true strength of quantum computing lies in its ability to navigate vast quantities of possibilities, sifting through them to extract potential solutions to intricate challenges.\n\nAt the core of this technology are qubits, which encode information in a quantum state that transcends the binary limitations of 0 and 1, encompassing a multidimensional spectrum.\n\nWhat are qubits made of in quantum systems? The composition of qubits varies depending on the architecture, with specific requirements for optimal functionality. Cold temperatures are often necessary. Qubits can consist of trapped ions, photons, artificial or natural atoms, or even quasiparticles.\n\nOperating on the principles of quantum mechanics, these computers introduce a new lexicon of terms requiring comprehension.\n\nLet’s explore the three key principles in more detail below:\n\nSuperposition\n\nJust as classical physics allows adding waves, quantum states can be combined, resulting in new valid ones. Moreover, any quantum state can be expressed as a sum of multiple distinct states.\n\nThis remarkable feature, known as superposition, grants quantum computers inherent parallelism. Harnessing this parallelism enables these machines to execute millions of operations simultaneously.\n\nEntanglement\n\nQuantum entanglement occurs when two systems become intricately connected, regardless of their physical distance. Entanglement is remarkable because acquiring information about one particle instantly reveals details about the other, regardless of their spatial separation.\n\nThis unique relationship forms the basis for quantum algorithms designed to tackle complex problems. Moreover, the addition of qubits results in an exponential surge in computational capabilities.\n\nDecoherence\n\nDecoherence arises when qubits lose their quantum behavior due to external factors like vibrations or temperature fluctuations. Such disturbances can cause qubits to lose their superposition state and introduce errors in computations.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, protective measures are necessary, such as utilizing insulation, supercooled refrigerators, and vacuum chambers to shield qubits from external interference.\n\nQuantum Computing vs. Classical Computing: What is the Difference?\n\nClassical and quantum computing differ in their building blocks. Traditional computers use binary digits (0s and 1s), while quantum computers use qubits. This makes quantum computers highly efficient for complexAI applications, as they are less prone to errors than classical computers.\n\nQuantum computing enhances classical computing by improving specialized functions and offering greater accuracy and efficiency. They process data faster, enabling faster learning and improvement for AI systems. Quantum entanglement optimizes correlations between variables.\n\nQuantum computers excel at solving complex optimization problems, leading to more powerful and intelligent AI systems beyond classical physics laws. They benefit various AI applications like planning and scheduling.\n\nThey accelerate AI architecture development, performing calculations and creating new algorithms that classical computers can’t. They provide solutions to unsolvable problems using classical methods.\n\nQuantum computers enable faster learning and robust simulations for real-world scenarios without catastrophic forgetting, ensuring lifelong learning without losing previous knowledge.\n\nQuantum computers also provide data security and can countercybercrimethrough parallel processing. Their ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously aids in discovering superior algorithms.\n\nThe Impact of Quantum Computing on Artificial Intelligence\n\nQuantum computing boosts the potential of AI by amplifying its velocity, efficacy, and precision. It transcends the limitations imposed on traditional computers by utilizing qubits and capitalizing on non-linear operations.\n\nThis remarkable advancement empowers quantum computing to find applications across diverse AI use cases. Sectors like maritime logistics, semiconductors, electric vehicles, luminescence, and power have already started reaping the rewards of quantum computing’s exceptional problem-solving prowess.\n\nLet’s explore the impact of quantum computing on different industries and the transformative effects it brings to AI-driven processes.\n\nMedical Care\n\nHospitals often form a medical board of specialists from diverse fields to address complex conditions in critically ill patients.\n\nHowever, this traditional approach is time-consuming and hampers decision-making. Quantum computing offers a solution.\n\nBy inputting various possibilities and relevant historical data,healthcareprofessionals can leverage quantum computing to evaluate treatment effectiveness and receive optimal recommendations swiftly.\n\nThe quantum advantage allows providers to acquire valuable insights in a considerably reduced time frame.\n\nMachine Learning (ML)\n\nMachine learning (ML) relies on computers’ ability to acquire knowledge from data and generate or recognize patterns, similar to how the human brain functions.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness ofmachine learningcan be hindered by subpar data quality and the sluggish availability of data. This is where quantum computing comes into play, offering the potential to rapidly process large volumes of data rapidly, thus granting machine learning the same advantage.\n\nA notable example of this potential is a collaborative project, “Quantum Advantage in Learning from Experiments,” involving scientists from renowned institutions like Caltech, Harvard, Berkeley, and Microsoft.\n\nPublished findings reveal the exceptional performance of their quantum computer, Sycamore, compared to classical learning agents, demonstrating exponential superiority across a diverse range of tasks, highlighting the remarkable capabilities of quantum learning agents.\n\nCryptography and Security\n\nQuantum computing can make it harder for unauthorized parties to breach data using qubits to calculate all possible breach methods, allowing for stronger security measures.\n\nHowever, critics argue that this very power of quantum computing could be leveraged by hackers to quickly devise strategies for infiltrating servers containing sensitive data, potentially compromising existing security measures.\n\nThat is why the development of quantum-resistant cryptography is a main focus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Through itsPost-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Program, NIST aims to create a stronger cryptographic system that can withstand quantum attacks, surpassing the current widely adopted methods.\n\nThis pursuit of enhanced security measures is closely tied to the geopolitical landscape, as it fuels the competition between the United States and China in the race to advance quantum technology.\n\nFinancial Application\n\nQuantum computing’s integration promises to enhance market predictions and risk management.\n\nMultiverse Computing, Pasqal, and Crédit Agricole recently completed a 1.5-yearproof-of-concept studyon quantum computing’s potential in financial product valuation and credit risk assessment.\n\nNotable advancements were achieved, reducing computing time and memory usage. Using a mere 50-qubit quantum processor, accurate results comparable to conventional methods were obtained, paving the way for real-world applications, specifically in derivatives valuation.\n\nAnticipated advancements are on the horizon as a 300-qubit quantum processor is expected to become accessible in 2024. This breakthrough research marks the introduction of the inaugural quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm designed specifically for forecasting credit rating downgrades.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nQuantum computing can enhancenatural language processing(NLP) and speech recognition, leading to more efficient and accurate communication. In that sense, quantum NLP (QNLP) aims to surpass the capabilities of traditional NLP by translating language into coded circuits processed by quantum computers.\n\nAdvancements in quantum computing enable QNLP to deliver enhanced effectiveness, faster processing, reduced power consumption, and a smaller environmental footprint. QNLP leverages quantum computing to accelerate the training process for data-intensive AI models, resulting in reduced training time.\n\nFor instance,Quantinuum(a company that integrates software and hardware solutions for quantum computing), with expertise in QNLP, recently collaborated with UCL and the BBC to explore the commercial potential in content discovery and archive retrieval.\n\nThrough the transformation of sentences into logical formats and the use of string diagrams, QNLP simplifies NLP design on quantum hardware. These encoded quantum circuits can be optimized for machine learning applications.\n\nWhat are the Advantages of Quantum Computing in AI?\n\nThe exponential growth of complex data sets has surpassed the capabilities of traditional computers, putting a strain on our existing systems. However, quantum computing emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe ability of quantum computing to process vast amounts of data at an astonishing speed is of utmost importance when it comes to tackling intricate problems.\n\nQuantum simulations, in particular, hold significant promise in addressing complex issues like climate change and healthcare.\n\nApart from the incredible speed and the ability to handle complex data sets, quantum computing brings several other benefits to AI. Keep reading to find out what they are.\n\nOptimizing Solutions\n\nQuantum computing empowers us to make optimal decisions in portfolio analysis, delivery routes, andpersonalized treatment protocols.\n\nAs big data shapes our computer architecture, we require a different approach to effectively handle it. Quantum computers excel at solving sequential problems, offering better decision-making capabilities for businesses and consumers. This encourages investments in this emerging technology.\n\nSpotting Patterns in Large Data Sets\n\nQuantum computing can rapidly search for patterns or anomalies in vast, unsorted data sets. It has the ability to simultaneously access all items in a database, identifying similarities within seconds.\n\nCurrent technologies rely on sequential examination, which is time-consuming and impractical for large data sets.\n\nFacilitating Integration of Diverse Data Sets\n\nQuantum computers will enable breakthroughs by integrating vastly different data sets. Initially, human intervention may be necessary to guide the integration process.\n\nWhen we analyze raw data from diverse sources with distinct structures, it is crucial to understand how these structures are related to each other.\n\nAdvancements in natural language analysis, a significant challenge in artificial intelligence, are required for this task. Human input plays a vital role in training the system for future integration.\n\nVideo source: YouTube/Tech with Hira Khan\n\nWhat are the Challenges of Quantum Computing in AI?\n\nQubit decoherence, the loss or degradation of quantum information in a qubit, stands as one of the most significant hurdles in the realm of quantum computing.

        "content": "SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain, Nov. 29, 2023 —Multiverse Computing, a global leader in value-based quantum computing and machine learning solutions, has used a digital twin and quantum optimization to boost the efficiency of green hydrogen production. This work could change the economics of hydrogen production and reduce a significant source of greenhouse gas.\n\nMultiverse’s partners in this work are IDEA Ingeniería, an engineering firm that specializes in renewable projects and digital twins, and AMETIC, Spain’s digital industry association. IDEA developed the digital twin ecosystem for optimizing the generation of green hydrogen. AMETIC is coordinating the overall project.\n\nThe quantum digital twin numerically simulates a green hydrogen production plant by using operating parameters of the plant as inputs. By using quantum algorithms to optimize the electrolysis process used for green hydrogen generation, the developed solution achieves a 5% increase in H2 production and associated revenue delivered by the quantum solver compared to the classical solver.\n\n“Electrolysers are currently deployed at a small scale, making hydrogen production costly, so they require significant scale up in an affordable way,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, CEO of Multiverse Computing. “This project demonstrates how quantum algorithms can improve the production of green hydrogen to make renewable energy more cost-effective today and in the future.”\n\nUsing a classical solver to optimize hydrogen production, the virtual plant delivered 62,579 kg of green H2 and revenue of 154,204 euros. By using quantum-inspired tensor networks with Multiverse’s Singularity, the quantum approach delivered 65,421 kg and revenue of 160,616 euros. This represents a 5% increase in hydrogen production and a 5% increase in revenues produced.\n\n“Green hydrogen will play a significant role in the transition towards a more sustainable and ecological energy landscape,” said Emilio Sanchez, Founder and CEO of IDEA Ingeniería. “The consortium’s continued progress in developing quantum solutions alongside other green technologies can help alleviate the effects of global warming.”\n\nCurrently, it’s more expensive to produce green hydrogen than traditional grey hydrogen.1 The traditional method uses electricity—usually generated by coal or natural gas—to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. Green hydrogen is produced from renewable sources.\n\nAbout 70 million tons of hydrogen are produced every year and used to refine oil and make ammonia-based fertilizer. The grey hydrogen production process generates between 9 and 12 tons of carbon dioxide for every one ton of hydrogen produced.2 Green hydrogen created from renewable sources is a clean-burning fuel that could reduce emissions from heating and industrial processes such as the production of steel, cement, and fertilizer.\n\nGreen hydrogen also could enable more efficient energy storage, as compressed hydrogen tanks can store energy for long periods of time and weigh less than lithium-ion batteries. In addition, it could make the transportation industry greener by decarbonizing shipping, aviation, and trucking.\n\nMultiverse’s future plans for the initiative include increasing the input parameters to create a more realistic quantum digital twin and working with an energy company to validate the digital model, and continue working on the improvement of the quantum solution developed.\n\nAbout Multiverse Computing\n\nMultiverse Computing is a leading quantum software company that applies quantum and quantum-inspired solutions to tackle complex problems in finance, banking, manufacturing, energy, and cybersecurity to deliver value today and enable a more resilient and prosperous economy.

        "title": "Multiverse Computing Launches CompactifAI to Streamline LLMs to Reduce Energy Use and Compute Costs",
        "date": "November 15, 2023",
        "content": "SAN SEBASTIÁN, SPAIN, November 15, 2023 /EINPresswire.com/ --Multiverse Computing, a global leader in value-based quantum computing solutions, today announced CompactifAI, a solution for the high compute cost of machine learning algorithms. This new tool for managing the significant energy demands required to train and run large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard is designed to reduce development costs and make it easier to integrate these models into more digital services.\n\nCompactifAI uses tensor networks to reduce the number of parameters in a model, reducing its overall size as well as shrinking memory and storage space requirements. Retraining has the potential to be faster as well since users can add new data to an existing model that has already been compressed to generate an updated model that retains the benefits of compression while preserving the quality of results.\n\nCompactifAI is designed to reduce energy requirements at multiple points in the lifecycle of an LLM, including the training phase, general operations and retraining. Multiverse’s new software also reduces the overall footprint of the models, making them more portable and easier to run at the edge in applications such as autonomous vehicles and remote production facilities. A video showing how CompactifAI works isavailable here.\n\n“This new tool will lift a major barrier to the growth of large language models across industries: the sheer size of these algorithms and data sets and the energy required to run them,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, CEO of Multiverse Computing. “CompactifAI also opens the door to new LLM uses cases for on premise, on the edge and other applications where there is no dedicated cloud connection.”\n\nA new study of AI energy consumption found that by 2027 worldwide AI-related electricity consumption each year could match the annual energy use of countries such as the Netherlands, Argentina and Sweden.[1,2] The research conclusions are based on estimations of the amount of energy needed to run the most popular servers that power LLMs. The research also considered increased usage as the models become integrated into popular search engines and other elements of internet infrastructure.\n\nLLMs already consume a significant amount of energy in both the training phase and in daily operations. A University of Washington researcher estimates that a single LLM could require up to 10 gigawatts of power during the training phase, equal to the energy use of more than 1,000 U.S. households annually. To respond to hundreds of millions of queries each day, those same models could use up to 1 gigawatt of power each day, which is roughly equal to the daily energy usage rate of 33,000 US households.\"LLMs demand significant energy, compute power, and memory resources during their training process and during their lifecycle,” said Rafael San Juan, Global Innovation Manager at Iberdrola, one of the world’s largest electric utility providers and Multiverse customer. “An innovative solution capable of optimizing use of resources holds the potential to revolutionize the landscape, minimizing the impact this has on the electric grid and enabling the true scaling of LLM solutions.”The software offers low, medium and high options for compressing a model, depending upon the application requirements for a particular LLM. Multiverse expects AI developers to be the initial users for this software-as-a-service platform.Originally used in the study of condensed matter physics, a tensor network is a visual language that describes complex systems. This visual language makes it easier to understand how each component in the system interacts with all the others and to predict the results of those interactions. Extracting information from tensor networks is relatively straightforward, providing another benefit to this approach to computation.Multiverse Computing’s Chief Science Officer Roman Orus was one of the first researchers to study tensor networks during a research fellowship at the University of Queensland in 2006. As a co-founder of the company, he applied this knowledge in one of Multiverse’s first projects: using tensor networks for portfolio optimization with a multinational bank.More recently, researchers have used tensor networks as models for machine learning architecture and to compress the layers in neural networks. Tensor networks can be mapped directly to quantum circuits as well. Researchers expect tensor networks to serve as a bridge between today’s noisy quantum computers and the fault tolerant machines of the future.\n\nFull articlehere"

This latest event is a great example of what’s possible when we work together.”\n\nThe growing quantum market opportunity covers a lot of ground between sensing, computing hardware, software, and communications. Here’s a sampling of solutions and growth opportunities from three of the webinar panelists.\n\nQuantum Sensing:AtExail Technologies, easy-to-use quantum sensing technology is behind a new breed of precision sensors developed to help customers monitor natural resources in severe environmental conditions.\n\nVincent Menoret, quantum sensing expert at Exail, said the company’s culture revolves around making long-lasting and reliable products designed for non-technical people in the field. Its customers are geophysicists with little knowledge of lasers and atomic physics. All they need to do is plug in a few cables and press start in the software and everything runs automatically. Having demonstrated its systems in the field throughout the world in volcanoes, Antarctica, and other harsh conditions, Exail’s next step is using sensors on ground infrastructure, ships, and mobile vehicles to monitor different environments.\n\nQuantum Computing:Quandelahas developed a photonic quantum computer that runs quantum machine learning, optimization, and simulation algorithms. The startup launched a 6-qubit machine in 2022 and has sold a quantum computer to a European cloud provider.\n\nArno Ricou, applications lead at Quandela, said that the company’s machines give customers a quantum advantage in cryptography for highly secure data encryption. Quandela also develops cutting-edge algorithms aimed to offer customers a practical competitive advantage in solving differential equations, classifying data points, and tackling graph problems using permanent computation.\n\nQuandela opened a quantum computer manufacturing facility in France and has ambitious targets to increase qubit capabilities of its machines during the next few years.\n\nQuantum software:Multiverse Computingoffers a quantum-based software platform for different sectors such as finance, energy, manufacturing, cybersecurity, and chemistry. Alba Villarino, a quantum software engineer at Multiverse, discussed a successful pilot solution for a manufacturing company that improved production line efficiency in defect reduction compared to traditional methods. Multiverse is also working with a Spanish energy company in a quantum computing project targeting power grid optimization, specifically the optimal placement of batteries in the electrical network.\n\nThese innovators are just a few of the noteworthy product launches from the fast-growing quantum tech ecosystem that’s destined to turn this artisanal sector into a billion-dollar market engine of industry disruption.\n\nFull article by Forbeshere."

Together, the trio will usequantumcomputing to address the computational challenges in existing large-scale flood modelling, and develop new prediction models that assess risks more accurately and efficiently.\n\nCurrent methods have been limited by the increased computational cost of running sophisticated simulations over large areas in high-resolution. But according to Sergio Gago, Moody’s Managing Director of Quantum and GenAI, the emergence of new technologies, such as quantum computing, presents significant opportunities for advancement.\n\n“Specifically, there is promising potential in the application of quantum machine learning (QML) to develop emulators as alternatives to traditional physics-based models,” Gago said. Similarly, Enrique Lizaso Olmos, founder and CEO of Multiverse Computing, believes that the improved accuracy and effectiveness of a quantum approach could contribute to climate change adaptation efforts.\n\nThe Spanish startup is the lead contractor of the project and will be behind the software and quantum algorithm development. OQC will provide the necessary quantum hardware, while Moody’s will contribute industry, data, and computational efficiency insights.\n\nThe project has won a place in Phase 1 of the Quantum Catalyst Fund competition, backed by Innovate UK. If successful, it will move to Phase 2 next year, and the budget will amount to £1.2mn.\n\nThe UK Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs will be the first customer to try the solution, seeking to better adapt to extreme weather events resulting from climate change. According to Moody’s estimates the UK is facing over £700mn in losses due to inland flooding per year.\n\nSadly, examples of the phenomenon’s devastating impact are far too many.

It is equal to 30% of R&D expenditures up to EUR 100 million; beyond this threshold, the rate is reduced to 5%. For companies entering the scheme for the first time, the applicable rate is 50% for the first year, and 40% for the second year. Other public support to R&D (subsidies, refundable loans, etc.) must be deducted from the base to compute the credit.\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity to advance your quantum computing R&D projects with Multiverse Computing, a recognized player in driving innovation and tackling complex computational challenges"

        "content": "Here’s How It Worked…\n\nFinancial indexes often consist of hundreds of thousands of assets and an important task to make it practical to manage such portfolios is replicating the financial index using a limited subset of assets, known as cardinality constraints. Such constrained portfolio optimization is extremely difficult to solve using classical computing, and standard algorithms tend to have difficulty finding appropriate solutions.\n\nCollaborating with global consulting firm Protiviti and quantum software development firm Multiverse Computing, Ally developed a way around the classic cardinality-constraint issue by using quantum annealing, a specialized type of quantum computing that is excellent at optimization problems. The team worked to construct cardinality-constrained portfolios that replicated the return of financial indices.\n\nQuantum annealers focus on solving problems with a lowest-energy-state answer and may also be referred to as peak-and-valley problems of optimization. Annealers can be efficient by ignoring the peaks (in this case, investments that exceed constraints) and focusing on just the best valleys. There is no correct answer, just a reasonably best answer, provided in an incredibly small amount of time.\n\nUsing hybrid classical-quantum approaches, the project team built static portfolios that replicated, and even beat, the 1-year daily returns of both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 indices, while using only a fraction of the companies in those indices. This was accomplished using the latest Hybrid Solver system from D-Wave. The team then used the new algorithmic approach to build the replicating portfolios. This new algorithm can be used for managing ETFs with the benefits being the reduction of overhead costs for financial managers and keeping fees low for customers. We anticipate that this approach will be recognized as a significant innovation for investing tools in financial services.\n\n\n\nFull articlehere\n\n"

And this is nothing new. This has existed for a while, but recently there have been a lot of advances in this field. These advances have enabled us to have greater control of these systems to perform tasks.\n\nAnd it may sound a little bit counterintuitive, but you can think of classical computing, if I use an analogy, like flipping a coin. With classical computing, you have bits which are zero or one, heads or tails. Quantum computing is based on quantum bits, or what we call qubits. And the analogy would be that it is like spinning a coin. It can be heads, or tails, or anywhere in between all of those at once.\n\nThat is the essential phenomena behind quantum computers. Quantum computers harness these counterintuitive but very strong powers of quantum physics principles to exponentially boost computational powers. So, you can solve complex problems much faster compared to classical computing. It is not per se an upgrade to conventional computing, but a new paradigm shift.\n\nQuantum computing has both the potential to both create and solve security challenges. How should central banks balance that?\n\nWithout going into the details of quantum physics and qubits because there are properties like entanglement and superposition, we think these machines can perform certain tasks that classical computers cannot do. So that means amongst those tasks, if we have large-scale quantum computers, then those computers will be able to break many of the current encryption protocols we use to do financial transactions, securing data or, really, anything online.\n\nExplore Central Banking's articleherefor a detailed elaboration on the collaboration between Bank of Canada and Multiverse."

Quantum computers are no exception to this trend. Being equipped with qubits instead of bytes is all well and good, but you still need a way of telling the machine how to harness those nifty, slippery particles and define their calculations. It should be of little surprise to loyal readers, then, that more than a few companies in the quantum ecosystem are busilyproducing algorithms, operating systems and abstraction layers that tell the qubits what and how to perform set tasks, allowing the end user to write in Python, C++ or Q#.\n\nTo allow these languages to realise their full potential, major players in the quantum space have devised open source frameworks that include all the technology designed to run code on quantum hardware — thinkQiskitfrom IBM, orCirqby Google. But for a quantum computer to achieve advantage — or ‘utility’, as IBM is nowcalling it— the software layer needs to be even more abstract and easier to understand.\n\nOne company focusing on complete abstraction isMultiverse Computing. It offers aSaaSproduct called Singularity that, to the end user, appears as nothing more than another menu item in Microsoft Excel. That’s because, in the back end, Multiverse works with its clients to understand their data requirements to a point where they can be boiled down into the tailor-made, quantum equivalent of the flick of a switch.\n\nNone of this work necessarily requires a quantum computer, explains Esperanza Cuenca-Gómez, Multiverse’s head of strategy. “We use tensor networks,” says Cuenca-Gómez. “Quantum-inspired techniques use the principle of quantum mechanics and then those algorithms are deployed on high-performance classical hardware.”\n\nReal world results are already being seen and acted on from today’s quantum systems, she adds, even though the software layer isn’t necessarily being deployed on quantum hardware right now. That said, Cuenca-Gómez claims, it’s perfectly capable of being run on tomorrow’s quantum computers as and when they’re ready.\n\nFull article availablehere."

Unfortunately, quantum computing’s capabilities and differences from classical computers are still — in the main — poorly understood.\n\nWith quantum computers, tasks like artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) and cryptography that conventional computers are unable or find hard to handle can be accomplished using specialized hardware and software.\n\nThey are able to do this because quantum computers exploit quantum mechanical phenomena by using specialized hardware to leverage the particle and wave properties of physical matter at small scales.\n\nWith this, quantum computing companies are developing technologies to make this cutting-edge technology more accessible and useful. What The Quantum Insider can tell you is that quantum computing is booming with new innovations — both in industry and in research — being created every day.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the rise in quantum computing startups over the last decade or so.\n\nJust as a reminder, the list has been organized in alphabetical order and is non-exhaustive. If you would like an exhaustive, structured and filterable database with full company and technical details, seehere.\n\n[...]\n\nMultiverse Computing is a quantum computing software company that provides solutions for more than ten verticals, including finance, manufacturing and aerospace. Its team possesses expertise in portfolio optimization problems, risk analysis and market simulation.\n\nHave a look at the full article and Startup list from The Quantum Insiderhere."

        "content": "Applied quantum computing involves using quantum computing technology to solve real-world problems in various industries. We will talk about the most important quantum applications and delve into practical use cases for each one.\n\nFirstly, quantum computing may be able to simulate quantum systems, which can be useful in understanding molecule and material behaviour, benefitting verticals like materials science and drug discovery.\n\nCompanies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel have their own quantum computing research divisions while Airbus, Volkswagen and JP Morgan Chase are actively searching for solutions to some of their most pressing problems.\n\nGenerally, large companies use quantum computing to explore a wide range of applications in the emerging field and remain ahead of the curve. However, smaller companies and even startups are also in on the game, too.\n\nWith classical computers, as molecular interactions become more complex, calculations become less accurate. In the report,Exploring quantum use cases for chemicals and petroleum, published by IBM Institute for Business Value, one use case: “Developing chemical products, including catalysts and surfactants”, gives the example that the development of new chemical methods and materials is accelerated by the use of quantum computers in chemical and petroleum companies.\n\nTaken from aNaturecover story from 2017, the report goes on to explain how IBM’s publicly available quantum computers could be used to model lithium hydride (LiH) and beryllium hydride (BeH2) in the chemicals and petroleum industries. These same hybrid methods may soon be used such as to develop new catalysts for reducing emissions or surfactants to improve subsurface recovery, the report noted.\n\nProof of this can be seen with ExxonMobil. The company is advancing the use of quantum computing in developing next-generation energy and manufacturing technologies and sees potential applications including optimizing power grids, developing more accurate environmental models and developing highly accurate quantum chemistry calculations for discovering new materials to capture carbon more efficiently.\n\nSee also:11 Companies Using Quantum Technologies To Determine The Properties & Reactions of Chemical Substances\n\nNext,quantum computing is expected to improve financial modelling, thus improving market predictions and risk management.\n\nIn apress releasefrom January 2023, quantum computing companies Multiverse Computing, Pasqal and one of France’s largest banks Crédit Agricole announced the end of a 1.5-year POC study“to evaluate the contribution of an algorithmic approach inspired by quantum computing, and the potential of quantum computers, in two areas: the valuation of financial products, and the assessment of credit risks.”\n\nIn the news release, the companies cite papers that provide more details on the work, with the most recent,Quantum-Inspired Tensor Neural Networks for Option Pricing, published on ArXiv in the same month.\n\nIn the study, two experiments were addressed on successful derivatives calculation and counterparties downgrades anticipation, with the conclusion being drawn that“a marked improvement in computing time requiring a smaller memory footprint was measured using quantum computing techniques, paving the way for their use in real-world applications in the valuation of derivatives. For the quantum computer, the chosen problem was tackled under real-world conditions. With a quantum processor of only 50 qubits, the results obtained are as accurate as the results in production. Our projections indicate that this performance could be bettered at 300 qubits, a power that should be available industrially in 2024.”\n\nAs a result of their research, the authors claim that they have developed the first quantum-enhanced ML algorithm for predicting credit rating downgrades.\n\nSee Also:11 Global Banks Probing The Wonderful World of Quantum Technologies\n\nCheck out the full article by The Quantum Insiderhere.\n\n"

In the private sector, only 1 in 54 of all applicants for female roles are female, while almost 80% of quantum companies do not have a senior female figure. There is no data on sexual orientation or ethnicity.\n\nIn an industry that is forecast to be worth $8.6bn in 2027, we cannot afford to miss out on talent. Especially when that industry is going to help solve some of the world’s most intractable environmental and medical problems. D&I is key to accelerating innovation and creativity, and avoiding group think, as evidenced in areportfrom The Inclusion Initiative at the London School of Economics.\n\nIs there cause for hope? Definitely. Firstly, 62% of current employees in quantum want their employers to do more to increase diversity, according to recruitment firm Quantum Futures.\n\nSecondly, two new organisations are focused on change.DiviQwas formed a few months ago, with industry luminaries like whurley and Denise Ruffner on board. Its mission is to foster a diverse quantum workforce through supporting those from underrepresented backgrounds with education, networking opportunities and mentorship.

        "content": "One of the biggest barriers to wide-scale adoption of quantum computing is a lack of solutions that fit users without detailed experience and knowledge with this technology. Multiverse Computing, a leading quantum software company building quantum and quantum-inspired solutions, is helping executives close that gap by developing tools that can tackle complex problems in finance. Their flagship product, Singularity, enables professionals with no background in quantum computing to take advantage of its early business value.\n\nThe Singularity for Credit Scoring App features a user-friendly Excel interface to allow finance and banking professionals to solve complex classification problems using quantum and quantum-inspired classifiers from their mac or pc.Classification in Machine Learningis a supervised ML method by which the model attempts to predict the correct label of a given input data. The finance sector regularly uses machine learning methods for credit scoring, fraud detection, trading, and more.\n\nIn the example below, we will show how a major European bank used a quantum classifier to solve a credit scoring problem better than a classical classifier.\n\nStep 1: Formulation\n\nDescribe the credit rating problem in terms of binary classification:\n\n· 0: Borrower can repay\n\n· 1: Borrower fails to repay\n\nNext, input examples of borrowers that have successfully and unsuccessfully repaid loans with a variety of features or characteristics that contribute to prediction by the ML model. In this example, 1,000 examples are given for the quantum classifier with 10 features (loan amount, duration, work status, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Selection of training data\n\nBefore training begins, select the data along with the percentage of data to be used for training and testing.\n\n\n\nBased on this selection, Singularity will create two new pages: a trained datasheet and a test datasheet.\n\n\n\nAs shown in the trained datasheet above, the popup window can be used to do feature selection, where certain features that were added in step one can be selected and unselected based on preference.\n\nStep 3: Training\n\nAt this step, a hybrid quantum-classical or a quantum-inspired algorithm is trained on the selected training data and returns the final predictor. Once complete, the add-in provides the details of the job and training, including the number of qubits, optimization time, and total training time, normally of the order of 30–50 seconds.\n\nStep 4: Prediction\n\nSingularity loads the default test data, which can be customized during the split of data in step 2. Labels can also be selected to compare theground truth labelswith predicted labels, allowing the user to compute evaluation metrics such as the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.\n\n\n\nThen, a “Quantum Results” page is created, assigning a prediction to each test example in terms of the 1 or 0 (repay/cannot repay) established in step 1.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nFor this use-case, the quantum model outperformed the classical linear regression model across all standard metrics, including accuracy (77% vs 74.8%), recall (45.9% vs 40.7%), and precision (68.3% vs 62.2%).\n\nBased on our past experience, an important KPI is the number of clients falsely predicted as default, as this could lead to the bank losing its clients. While the classical solution resulted in 37.8% false positives, the quantum solution had only 31.7%, a significant reduction of 16%.\n\nHow do you need to get started?\n\nHere’s what you need to begin using quantum machine learning techniques today:\n\n· Windows 10\n\n· Excel\n\n· Singularity Add-in\n\n· Authentication key (provided to add-in users by Multiverse)\n\nUsers of Singularity also have access to a user guide for help with installation, authentication, preparing data, training your model, potential problems, and general guidelines.\n\nContact us hereto learn more.\n\nArticle published on Mediumhere."

        "title": "‘Quantum Calculator’ Algorithm Tackles Optimization Problems",
        "date": "April 18, 2023",
        "content": "Multiverse Computing has developed a “quantum calculator” algorithm intended to transform a quantum computer into a mathematical tool for executing complex calculations that are currently carried out by specialized software to solve problems like optimization. The calculations are on par with the results obtained by the highest-performance conventional computers and will improve as quantum computing capability grows, proving that quantum computers can be useful now, according to Multiverse, a deep-tech company with headquarters in San Sebastian, Spain, and subsidiaries in Toronto, Paris and Munich.\n\nQuantum computing promises extraordinary increases in computational speed and power relative to today’s computers, yielding benefits in fields like pharmaceuticals, healthcare, manufacturing, cybersecurity and finance. For example, quantum computing can accelerate financial portfolio management models, such as the Monte Carlo model, for calculating likely outcomes and attendant risks. The computers can carry out multiple sophisticated calculations simultaneously, which is especially helpful for factorizations and could advance the development of decryption technology.\n\nQuantum computers can run challenging simulations, as they can mimic highly complex systems at speeds well beyond the reach of traditional computers. Molecular simulations, which are crucial in the creation of prescription drugs, might benefit from this capability. And quantum computers’ promised optimization results, with their ability to process enormous volumes of complex data, could revolutionize artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nResearch collaborations and investments by large tech companies have advanced the technology in recent years to the point where the first commercial quantum computers have been built and brought to market, though these early models are constructed from sparse sets of noisy qubits. Future CPUs will likely be more powerful and noise-resistant, if historical trends provide any indication. In the meantime, the task is to put today’s noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to productive use.\n\nOptimization is an important area in which today’s NISQ devices can start to add value. Hybrid quantum-classical solutions can deploy modern quantum annealers to address challenging optimization problems in practical settings.\n\nAn optimization problem entails maximizing or reducing a function in relation to a set that represents the range of options possible in a particular circumstance. The tool enables comparison of the various options to identify which may be the best.\n\nOptimization problems can be classified according to the types of variables they deal with:• In continuous optimization, all the variables in the problem can take continuous values.• In discrete optimization, all the variables in the problem can take values only on a finite set.• In mixed optimization, some of the variables are continuous and others are discrete.\n\nAdditionally, an optimization problem is said to be a linear program or linear programming problem (LP) if both the function to be optimized and the function describing the constraint are linear. Conversely, a nonlinear program or nonlinear programming problem (NLP) is an optimization problem in which one of the functions is nonlinear.\n\nA typical combinatorial optimization problem, important in theoretical computer science and operations research, is the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The cities that the salesman might visit are the points in the problem statement, and the goal of the TSP is to minimize the travel time and distance to minimize costs.\n\nThis seemingly simple example can be solved using integer linear programming, but it has been demonstrated that the exact solution of the TSP requires algorithms with exponential complexity. The TSP is therefore said to be an NP-hard problem (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time).\n\nIn the case of nonlinear programming, where either the objective function or the constraint function is nonlinear (i.e., includes nonlinear operations), the complexity spirals and the optimization problem grows even more challenging. As a result, approximate linear models are usually chosen, even when a nonlinear objective would be the more appropriate approach given the conditions.\n\nCheck out the full article by Stefano Lovati on EE Times Europehere."

        "content": "The quantum sector is at the forefront of technology, dealing with some of the world’s most pressing issues, such as energy provision and supply chain logistics. It relies on its workforce to be innovative and creative. However, diversity is lacking: only 1 in 54 applicants for quantum roles are female, while 80% of quantum companies do not have a senior female figure, according to search firm Quantum Futures.\n\nThe City Quantum Summit briefing, by Cecily Josten, Dr Grace Lordan and Karina Robinson, calls for the importance of debiasing search and hiring, encouraging task-based assessments to overcome affinity-based hiring from over-relying on interviews. It also asks that Diversity & Inclusion is treated like any other major business priority. Finally, the briefing states that the quantum sector needs to invest in upskilling leaders in inclusive leadership, so that every leader ensures that all colleagues get equal opportunities, visibility and voice.\n\nKarina Robinson, Founder of The City Quantum Summit and Senior Advisor to Multiverse Computing, said: “The future of inclusion in quantum comes down to collaboration – measuring success, measuring failure – and sharing that with other firms to learn from each other. Without that, we are likely to repeat the mistakes of the past.”\n\nDr Grace Lordan, Director of the Inclusion Initiative and author ofThink Big, said: “Quantum computing will play a big role in shaping our world in the future. It is important that the world is shaped by people with different perspectives and backgrounds. Women are few and far between in the sector right now: we need to change this.”\n\nCecily Josten, TII Researcher, said: “The quantum industry is missing out on talent, innovation and productivity without diverse hiring and being inclusive employers.”\n\nRead full article by The London School of Economics and Political Sciencehere."

        "date": "April 17, 2023",
        "content": "Singularity is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that contains quantum-inspired and quantum algorithms developed and patented through proof-of-concept trials performed by the company for their services and industrial clients. These patented quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms can solve the most difficult industrial problems and are implemented as SaaS in the Singularity software development kit (SDK).\n\nAlthough advanced quantum techniques drive the performance of the Singularity SDK, professionals lacking specialized quantum computing expertise or knowledge can use the platform with ease due to its intuitive and simple plug-ins and front-ends for the common personal computer (PC)-based applications. For instance, users can optimize an investment portfolio by simply connecting the Singularity plug-in to their Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.\n\nInitially, the platform pre-processes the data collected from the user and determines the optimal quantum computer and algorithm to deliver immediate business value. Subsequently, the platform sends the data to the quantum computer to deploy the proprietary algorithms of Multiverse Computing. Finally, the queues are managed by Singularity to retrieve and send the results back to the user.\n\nAbout Multiverse Computing\n\nMultiverse Computing is a leading value-based quantum computing solution provider in the world. The deep tech company based in Spain develops quantum software to solve complex practical problems. Founded in 2019 by leading finance and quantum computing experts, the company's expertise in quantum-inspired and quantum algorithms enables it to realize the best results from the current quantum devices and classical high-performance computers.\n\nThe company's vision is to make powerful quantum computing algorithms accessible to everyone. Multiverse Computing has created solutions for companies in cyber-attack detection, logistics, space communication, energy, advanced manufacturing verticals, life sciences, mobility, and finance verticals. The company currently has fully-owned subsidiaries in Munich, Paris, and Toronto.\n\nSolving Complex Real-World Challenges Using Singularity\n\nSingularity can provide solutions to optimization, stochastic, system simulation, and machine learning (ML) challenges across several verticals, including chemistry, defense, cybersecurity, aerospace, engineering, health and life sciences, mobility, manufacturing, and energy. The toolkit can be effectively used to explore quantum and quantum-inspired solutions to typical analytical problems in the financial industry.\n\nFor instance, Multiverse Computing has introduced a quantum-based Fair Price solution for investment portfolios. This new addition to the Singularity platform that runs on IonQ quantum hardware with PC software tools can deliver higher accuracy in fair price calculations for financial institutions compared to the existing classical computing methods.\n\nFinancial institutions calculate the theoretical value of companies using Monte Carlo simulations on classical computers to determine the fair price of a stock to reduce risks. The institutions typically run these simulations on supercomputers that require 24 hours or more to complete, as extremely high accuracy is required to minimize losses.\n\nThe Singularity Fair Price solution can reduce the error rates by 43% compared to a classical computer using IonQ’s trapped ion quantum computers with common PC-based software tools without increasing the runtime or number of runs, allowing financial institutions to achieve a more accurate valuation quickly.\n\nRecently, Multiverse Computing released a new Singularity SDK version (v 1.2) for portfolio optimization using quantum computing. The Microsoft Excel plug-in of this platform delivers similar results as industry-standard solutions for large problems in a shorter duration.\n\nCurrently, the Singularity Portfolio Optimization Excel plug-in offers three solvers, including the Multiverse Hybrid for best results, the D-Wave Leap Hybrid, and a classical solver for advanced users for benchmarking purposes.\n\nThe highly efficient Multiverse Hybrid Solver combines the strength of quantum and classical computing and can effectively address portfolio optimization problems. Specifically, the Hybrid Solver can optimize large portfolios with thousands of assets by finding the portfolio that can deliver the highest returns and produce the same results as industry-standard solvers within a considerably shorter duration.\n\nRead full article by AZO Quantumhere."

It could expand its development pipeline, hit fewer dead ends, and bring cures and treatments to market much faster, to the benefit of millions of people around the world.\n\nOr imagine that a logistics company could dynamically manage the routes for its fleet of thousands of trucks. It could not only take a mind-numbing range of variables into account and adjust quickly as opportunities or constraints arose; it could also get fresher products to store shelves faster and prevent tons of carbon emissions every year.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to transform these and many more visions into reality — which is why technology companies, private investors, and governments are investing billions of dollars in supporting ecosystems of quantum startups.1Much of the quantum research community is focused on showingquantum advantage, which means that a quantum computer can perform a calculation, no matter how arbitrary, that is impossible on a classical, or binary, computer. (See “A Quantum Glossary.”) Running a calculation thousands of times faster could create enormous economic value if the calculation itself is useful to some stakeholder in the market.\n\nCheck out the full Magazine Spring 2023 Issue by MIT Sloanhere."

        "content": "Quantum mechanics, which is the study of the behavior of sub-atomic particles, provides a way to enhance the use of machine learning to resolve inherently complex problems around optimization, product development and real-time decision making.\n\nThis quantum-inspired enhancement, known as a tensorized neural network, is helping companies realize savings in training for a wide range of applications, including self-driving vehicle simulations, natural language processing and even generative AI like ChatGPT.\n\nTensor networks address one of the constraints facing companies investing in machine learning: the scale of resources required to model and train systems representing complex, multi-dimensional entities like fluid dynamics or financial systems. More complexity represented in the modeling demands correspondingly higher resources in terms of energy, memory size and computing time for training with traditional neural networks on classical computers (see \"Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning\").\n\nQuantum-Inspired Tensor Networksne of the key features of a neural network is its robustness. When neural networks are trained on slightly different datasets, robustness means that they perform similarly. Think of it as wanting your self-driving car to know what to do if a red car is parked on the motorway, even if it has only seen blue cars parked on the motorway during its training.\n\nOne way to add robustness is to make neural networks highly redundant by adding more nodes (the building blocks of neural networks), connections and layers. Highly complex networks will tend to behave similarly, even if they have been trained slightly differently. Yet this robustness increases the number of variables to tune, leading to a trade-off between a model’s reliability and the added cost in terms of more time and computational memory required for training.\n\nRead full Forbes article by Sam Mugelhere."

        "title": "Useful Quantum Computing for Industry, Today",
        "date": "March 27, 2023",
        "content": "The quantum revolution is quietly gaining momentum. While on the surface it looks like nothing is changing, if we take a deep dive, we see that the first quantum processors are already tackling some of the world’s most intractable problems. Quantum processing is going to hit all industries and will change them forever. We are fortunate to live during this historic moment in which quantum technologies, beyond a physicist’s dream, are real and taking off.\n\nMany experts nonetheless fear the “quantum winter,” a period in which no dramatic improvements are made in the capabilities of quantum computers, so that the technology is “frozen.”\n\nToday’s quantum computers have hundreds of qubits—the quantum version of the binary bit (a variable that can be either 0 or 1). These qubits are prone to noise and, therefore, to error, so the computations carried out by today’s machines are far from perfect.\n\nThe long-term vision for quantum computing is the ability to leverage millions of noise-free qubits to carry out extremely hard calculations in a reliable way. As of today, however, we still do not know for sure how to scale up from hundreds of error-prone qubits to millions of error-free ones.\n\nThis is perhaps the most relevant experimental problem that we face in quantum computing, and to many, it is also a signal that it is still too early to find useful applications of quantum computers in real-life scenarios.\n\nAs an academic and entrepreneur, I respectfully disagree with this point of view. I am not saying that the problem does not exist; it certainly does. But in my opinion, we are asking the wrong question.\n\nRather than ask when quantum computers will be more powerful, we should be asking,What can we do now with today’s limited and noisy quantum computers?\n\nThis question is the right one from a pragmatic point of view. It’s also remarkably hard to answer. But if we manage to answer it, at least in part, then we can prove that quantum computers have value now.\n\nThis situation is not new; indeed, history teaches us that, when it comes to technology, asking the right question is more than half the challenge. Imagine going back to the 1970s and asking Apple whether its first computer had a speech recognition system. Obviously not—but that did not mean the machine was useless! You could do lots of useful things with the Apple-1, such as develop programs, play videogames and more.\n\nGo back even further and ask Alan Turing whether the machine he invented to decipher crypto codes could be used to play videogames. Complete nonsense—at the time.\n\nToday’s quantum computers have obvious limitations. We cannot run many of our favorite quantum algorithms beyond toy models that don’t represent real use cases. We cannot yet crack the RSA cryptosystem or search huge unstructured databases. At the same time, today’s quantum machines are not useless.\n\nSo, whatcanwe do with a quantum computer today that is useful in practice? You might be surprised to discover that we’re already doing a lot. In fact, the first prototypes of quantum computers are offering real industrial value in specific, well-targeted business applications. Some of these solutions are already moving into production.\n\nWhat matters in industry is findingbusiness advantage, i.e., applications for which, for whatever reason (perhaps even illogical ones), quantum computers can be more practical to use than classical resources. This is what matters in a business, and finding such applications is an art in itself.\n\nAs the World Economic Forum explains, quantum computing is expected to work best across three specific areas:materials science, optimization and artificial intelligence. With optimization in particular, companies across multiple industries are using quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms to test new solutions now.\n\nBanks, includingJPMorgan Chaseand Credit Agricole CIB, are applying quantum algorithms against optimization problems that cover portfolio optimization, index tracking, ETFs, trading decision systems, fraud detection, option pricing and credit scoring.\n\nIn another optimization use case, the Port of Los Angeles used a quantum-powered artificial intelligence engine toincrease the capability and velocity of cargo movement. The AI engine doubled the productivity of cargo handling equipment, produced more predictable cargo flows, optimized scheduling and streamlined container handling for trucking companies.\n\nGreen energy is another vertical with lots of applications. We have already seen business advantages in energy market optimization, energy production forecasting, windfarm design and more. Even small gains can return significant results. Forecasting renewable energy production is one of the industry’s most difficult challenges. Quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms can reduce the error rate in these predictions, in turn saving millions of euros per year.\n\nIn fact, the number of use cases is unending, because the core of the algorithms is universal and the technology transversal. Consider predictive maintenance, for example: The same algorithm used to determine the probability of a machine failure in a factory can be used in a hospital to predict a patient’s probability of having specific health problems, and even in soccer clubs to predict the probability of player injuries. And this is not sci-fi: All these use cases are already being implemented as you read this article.\n\nThe implications are enormous. When it comes to industry processes, quantum is not an alternative, but a necessity. And the quantum processors that we have available right now are already able to provide business value, beating internal benchmarks by using a combination of limited quantum hardware and clever algorithms.\n\nCompanies need to investigate where their advantage might be today from quantum before their competition does. It’s not an easy task, but with the right partners and elbow grease, it can be done.\n\nFind Roman Orus' column about finding value in quantum computing on EE Timeshere."

        "content": "Let’s be honest. We frequently (and recently) see quantum computing companies, startups, or ventures and their projects being scrutinized on three major fronts: true and broad quantum advantage, false promises and technology, and more technical explanations underneath epic superlatives and headlines such as “quantum is now”. Having this in mind, it is interesting to evaluate how some players that I had the chance to meet in person during theMobile World Congress 2023in Barcelona have a similar goal in mind.\n\nIt's almost certain that we won't have a broad quantum advantage right now. I've explained why in my previous posts. However, a number of companies that offer quantum software and consulting services, such asTerra Quantum,Multiverse Computing, andStafford Computing(to name a few), are putting this technology in the hands of companies in a variety of industries, with positive results in some cases. How is this possible if we still don’t have the quantum advantage and the machines are noisy and limited? This is because there is a way to extract benefits from the quantum side right now.\n\nD-Wave, which has been in the market for more than 20 years, is still involved in the debate over whether quantum annealing and their machines are true quantum computers, as well as whether the solutions truly come from the \"quantum side\" of the computation processes. But the truth is that some benefits are very tangible. Pier 300, which is the second largest container terminal at the Port of Los Angeles, was analyzed using a digital twin with the help of D-Wave by the companySavantX. The goal was to improve the way the import yard worked, especially in terms of where shipping containers were put and when trucks were scheduled to pick them up, so that the containers could leave as quickly as possible. Under the same conditions and simulation, the quantum KPIs were much better than the classical approach in terms of distance, cutting it by 73% compared to the classical method while keeping the same number of deliveries (80).\n\n[...]\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with very interesting people about the quantum ecosystem at MWC23, as well as participate as a speaker in a roundtable of top voices in quantum technology organized by Barcelona qbit and Mobile World Capital. There are two conversations that I want to highlight about the subject of this article.

Yet, in several cases, the neural networks are difficult to use because they are too resource intensive in terms of memory and suffer from lengthy processing times.However, algorithmic techniques inspired by quantum computing can be used to optimise the speed and memory required for this training phase, leading to faster valuations and more accurate risk assessments, says the bank.The second experiment sought to measure a quantum computer's ability to solve a concrete problem and to assess the change in performance depending on the number of qubits used.The bank chose a production use case, providing a real point of comparison: the anticipation of a counterparty credit rating downgrade over a six to 15-month period.

        "content": "French corporate and investment bank Crédit Agricole CIB announced the successful completion of two finance-related quantum computing experiments it undertook almost two years ago with fellow French firm Pasqal and Spain’s Multiverse Computing.\n\nThe bank said the successful completion of the experiments demonstrate that quantum computers using new algorithmic techniques already can perform on par with classical computers when tackling certain real-world financial problems, and further suggest that quantum advantage could be achievable for these problems as early as next year.\n\nCrédit Agricole CIB launched its work withPasqalandMultiversein June 2021, and the association quickly became a key talking point for each of these quantum computing start-ups as they sought to provide examples of interest by customers and partners in their solutions. Multiverse evenhired a Crédit Agricole vetas the general manager for its efforts in the French market. The experiments would take about a year and a half to complete.\n\nIn the first experiment the bank worked with Multiverse to assess the performance gain offered by quantum computing in the valuation of derivatives. Though research has demonstrated how neural networks can be used for such calculations, they often can be too resource-intensive in terms of memory and suffer from lengthy processing times.\n\n“However, algorithmic techniques inspired by quantum computing can be used to optimize the speed and memory required for this training phase, leading to faster valuations and more accurate risk assessments,” a statement from the companies said.\n\nThe second experiment intended to measure a quantum computer’s ability to solve a concrete problem, given the current state of technology. and assess the change in performance depending on the number of qubits used when addressing a real-world financial use case – the anticipation of a counterparty credit rating downgrade over a six-month to 15-month period. Classical computers and heuristics can be used to achieve good results, but do not work for all problems, and there is no guarantee that the results obtained will be close to the ideal solution, the companies said, adding “Using quantum parallelism, in theory, makes it possible to find optimum solutions more efficiently.”\n\nRegarding the success of the experiments, the companies stated, “A marked improvement in computing time requiring a smaller memory footprint was measured using quantum computing techniques, paving the way for their use in real-world applications in the valuation of derivatives. For the quantum computer, the chosen problem was tackled under real-world conditions. With a quantum processor of only 50 qubits, the results obtained are as accurate as the results in production.

        "content": "This is a brief post in response to the current focus on the topic. Something longer will follow.\n\nQ: Will quantum computers defeat encryption?\n\nA:Yes, certain types on encryption, including many that are in common use today.\n\nQ: Do we see that as an immediate, existential threat?\n\nA: No. Or, at least we didn’t a few weeks ago as the timeline for suitable quantum computers to be here was “years away”. The recent paper published by researchers in China has raised some interesting questions.\n\nThe paper was published a few weeks back but the news got into the mainstream press on 4 Jan and my inbox has been buzzing ever since.\n\nIf you haven’t heard about it,this article by Alexander Martinin The Record gives a useful (albeit quite technical) summary, including the reasons experts are sceptical.\n\nHave a read of the summary below, it’s just a few minutes. If it piques your interest as a topic the next point could be either my business-executive-friendly primer is available here (UK) or here (US) or here (on Medium))\n\nOr if you want something more technical this piece onQuantum Attack v Quantum Defence.\n\nSome context\n\nIn 1994 Peter Shor spiced up the nascent world of quantum computing theory by presenting an approach (now simply referred to as Shor’s Algorithm) that would allow quantum computers to crack certain types of mainstream encryption.\n\nThis was important insofar as it was one of the first specific ‘use cases’ for quantum computers. It was also highly theoretical as the hardware required to execute was in the far distant future.\n\nWhat is important to understand is that just aboutany encryption can be “decoded” mathematically. It’s just that it takes an awful lot of calculations and, even with the use of today’s strongest super computers, that means then even basic encryption can take years, decades or even millennia to decode. The way quantum computers do certain mathematical calculations makes them millions of times more efficient. However, the only quantum computers currently available are very early versions which people have never thought suited to apply Shor’s Algorithm in an effective manner.\n\nIt’s a bit like what we see with data transfer: these days we get frustrated if it takes more than a minute or so to download a two-hour video to our phone or tablet. In the 1990s when I first started travelling for work I was excited to get a 14.4KBps modem download speed. That meant synchronising Lotus Notes (there was not Outlook in those days) could require a full hour if there were even just 3 or 4 modest PowerPoint attachments. This was the norm. When Broadband came along, measured in MBps, things were far far better for email but we still didn’t dream of downloading full videos or music albums in moments.\n\nThat is where we are supposed to be now with Quantum Computers. Despite the incredible achievements of the past decade it is still early days. We call it theNISQ era(more here) as inNoise Intermediate-Scale Quantum, because the number of qubits and their quality is low.\n\nThis is supposed to be the period we move to detailed ideas of how we use quantum computers in the business world once they are available. (See e.g., the work that people likeEsperanza Cuenca Gomezaredoing at Multiverse Computing). It’snotthe year we’re supposed to be seeing them truly “in action”.\n\nTherefore the news that researchers have identified how to break a 2048-bit algorithm using a 372-qubit quantum computer is startling. IBM has machines that already have more qubits than that.\n\nFind Medium's full articlehere."

It may seem intimidating, but your approach to quantum computing—and quantum software development—will not be unlike any other technology that you have worked on. And building internal knowledge about quantum computing now will be critical to your future success.\n\nBut don’t stop there. As you create new quantum applications, file patents on those applications so that you can protect your intellectual property (IP). Quantum applications will begin creating business value and disruption within 10 years, but IP patents last 20 years. And the cost of filing a patent is trivial, but the cost of being patent-fenced out can be tremendous.\n\nQuantum patent filings are rising rapidly. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) are granting around 2,000 patents related to quantum technologies per year, according tothis academic paper, which shows the upward trend.\n\nChina holds the largest share (54%) of patents in all major types of quantum technologies, according toMcKinsey & Company, and China’sHuaweihas patented a quantum computer.IBMis also a leader in the quantum patent race. My company,Classiq, continues to file patent applications at the core of the quantum computing stack. Other technology solution providers such asMultiverse ComputingandQuantinuumhave filed recent quantum patents, too.\n\nThe businesses that employ solution providers’ technology are working to build quantum IP assets as well. The quantum computing exploration of insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (UHG) is largely driven by a desire to develop and protect intellectual property in this space, according toMatt Versaggi, who works for Optum Technology, the technology arm of UHG.\n\nAnd when Classiq recently asked more than 500 professionals across sectors whether their organizations are currently patenting or have plans to patent quantum software-related IP, 71% said yes. Ninety percent said that quantum computing could be an important source of IP for a company. And 73% said that they understand competing organizations patenting quantum software IP may block them from benefiting from future quantum computing applications.\n\nFull article by Forbeshere."

Watson Research Center in New York State’s Westchester County, scientists always keep a box of dental floss—Reach is the preferred brand—close by in case they need to tinker with their oil-drum-sizequantum computers, the latest of which can complete certain tasks millions of times as fast as your laptop.\n\nInside the shimmering aluminum canister of IBM’s System One, which sits shielded by the same kind of protective glass as the Mona Lisa, are three cylinders of diminishing circumference, rather like a set of Russian dolls. Together, these encase a chandelier of looping silver wires that cascade through chunky gold plates to a quantum chip in the base. To work properly, this chip requires super-cooling to 0.015 kelvins—a smidgen above absolute zero and colder than outer space. Most materials contract or grow brittle and snap under such intense chill. But ordinary dental floss, it turns out, maintains its integrity remarkably well if you need to secure wayward wires.\n\n“But only the unwaxed, unflavored kind,” says Jay Gambetta, IBM’s vice president of quantum. “Otherwise, released vapors mess everything up.”\n\nIt’s a curiously homespun facet of a technology that isset to transform pretty much everything. Quantum’sunique abilityto crunch stacks of data is already optimizing the routes of thousands of fuel tankers traversing the globe, helping decide which ICU patients require the most urgent care, and mimicking chemical processes at the atomic level to better design new materials. It also promises tosupercharge artificial intelligence, with the power to better train algorithms that can finally turn driverless cars and drone taxis into a reality. Quantum AI simulations exhibit a “degree of effectiveness and efficiency that is mind-boggling,” U.S. National Cyber Director Chris Inglis tells TIME.\n\nQuantum’s earliest adopters are asset-management firms—for which incorporating quantum calculations involves few increased overhead costs—but commercial uses aren’t far behind. Spanish firm Multiverse Computing has run successful pilot projects with multinational clients like BASF and Bosch that show its quantum algorithms can double foreign-exchange trading profits and catch almost four times as many production-line defects. “Quantum deep-learning algorithms are completely different from classical ones,” says Multiverse CEO Enrique Lizaso Olmos. “You can train them faster, try more strategies, and they are much better at getting the correlations that matter from a lot of data.”\n\nTech giants fromGoogletoAmazonandAlibaba—not to mention nation-states vying for technological supremacy—are racing to dominate this space. The global quantum-computing industry is projected to grow from $412 million in 2020 to $8.6 billion in 2027, according to anInternational Data Corp. analysis.\n\nClick here to read TIME's full articlehere."

        "content": "Quantum computing technologies are advancing and will likely transform many industries over the next decade. There’s much focus on the emerging technology’s use cases in finance, cybersecurity, material sciences, pharmaceuticals, and high-energy physics. However, industrial automation is one of the many other areas where transformation is expected.\n\nThe greatest uncertainty about when the quantum revolution will occur lies in the challenge of increasing the number of qubits—also known as quantum bits— in gate-based quantum computers. The crux of problem is that gate-based quantum computers are currently very error prone, and although increasing the number of qubits they use increases their processing power, it also exacerbates the error issue.\n\nWhile quantum physicists and engineers race to develop better error-correction techniques, enterprise early adopters are increasingly harnessing quantum computers made accessible via the public cloud to push performance gains in optimization problems, statistics and simulations while patiently working around the errors. Others embrace quantum annealers, which are devices that aren’t viewed in the same league as the holy grail of a fault-tolerant gate-based quantum computer, but are showing more immediate practicality as they aren’t as vulnerable to errors. There’s also hope that quantum analog simulators will show speedier progress compared to general-purpose digital quantum machines.\n\nThe growing subset of early adopters is expected to drive the global quantum computing market’s expansion by497%between 2022 and 2028. Companies like BMW, Toyota, Hyundai, Airbus, Fujifilm and many others are already getting practical value out of quantum computers despite the sector not yet reaching the milestone of quantum advantage. Although there’s widespread uncertainty about when the threshold will be breached, IBM is one of several players that’s ramping up efforts, targeting quantum advantage by2026through quantum error correction (QEC) techniques.\n\n[...]\n\nAdditionally, Multiverse Computing, a quantum software developer in San Sebastian, Spain, haspartneredwith the Bosch Automotive Electronics plant in Madrid to harness quantum computing to create a digital twin of a factory. Multiverse’s quantum-based optimization algorithms will assess the performance of equipment and production processes to enhance efficiency, energy and waste management.\n\nQuantum computingis already enhancing supply chain management. The computational power of quantum annealers can provide optimal transport routes, enhance fleet efficiency and improve air traffic control. Quantum computing has also reportedly played a role in getting food to North American grocery stores more efficiently. According to a report from Deloitte, a Canadian grocery store chain used quantum computing to reduce optimization computing time from25 hours to seconds. Additionally, the burgeoning field of quantum sensing is poised replace traditional field sensors to provide greater accuracy for industrial monitoring in factory settings or environmental monitoring in the field.\n\nRead full article by Jacob Bournehere."

        "content": "Early in October, US President Joe Biden traveled to Poughkeepsie, New York, and stood shoulder to shoulder with IBM executives as they announced that the company would be spending $20 billion on production of semiconductors and development of advanced technology like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC) research.\n\nBoth AI and QC will be critical for corporate effectiveness and national security in coming years. Linking AI and QC in the same news cycle was understandable too, given that QC represents to some degree the logical extension of AI.\n\nAI is often used in automating tedious tasks. Many of its achievements, such as facial recognition, are simply the result of raw computing power. Quantum tech expands computing power exponentially. Some believe it will eventually help doctors identify cancers earlier, pharmaceutical companies bring drugs to market faster, extend the life of batteries and more.\n\nIt may not take decades before real-world solutions emerge, either. “If publicly available vendor road maps hold, it is entirely possible to have quantum-enabled AI use cases in five years,” says Scott Buchholz, emerging technology research director and CTO for Government and Public Services at Deloitte Consulting.\n\nIndeed, some believe corporate and government leaders should begin laying out quantum-computing strategies now, “especially in industries, such as pharmaceuticals, that may reap the early benefits of commercial quantum computing,” says consulting firm McKinsey. While most activity is still in research or pilot phase, a few startups like Paris-based QC firm Pasqal are getting close to rollout. Pasqal already has a customer list that includes Johnson & Johnson, LG Electronics, Airbus, BMW, EDF, Thales, MBDA and Credit Agricole CIB.\n\nQuantum computing is based on “qubits” (quantum bits), which are the smallest units of quantum information, analogous to the regular computer bit. Qubits, IBM explains, “harness quantum mechanical phenomena ... to solve problems that are fundamentally intractable for classical computers.”\n\nThe sheer power of QC is mind boggling. A 2017 article in Scientific American claimed that “in principle, a 300-qubit quantum computer could perform more calculations at once than there are atoms in the observable universe.” That statement is now oft-repeated industry lore. Pasqal’s processors have already reached 100 qubits—close to the 127 qubits of IBM’s ground-breaking Eagle—and Pasqal expects to bring a 1,000-qubit processor to market by the end of 2023. Meanwhile, companies like IBM, Microsoft, Google and Honeywell have been investing heavily to expand the technology. In November, IBM unveiled its 433-qubit quantum processor called “Osprey.”\n\n“Quantum computing has the potential to ultimately be game changing in a number of ways,” says Charles Toups, vice president and general manager for Boeing Disruptive Computing and Networks. It could enable the aerospace giant to model complex materials more accurately and also “faster than we are able to complete small-scale, lower fidelity models today,” he says. Boeing sees promise, too, in using QC to model detailed chemical reactions “that will help us devise longer lasting protections for corrosion and ultraviolet exposure.”\n\nThe first areas likely to receive a QC boost are optimization, machine learning (ML—an essential component of AI, the terms are often used interchangeably) and predictive modeling, where finding solutions is “fiendishly difficult” but can be easier with quantum computers, given their “ability to handle data that has high degrees of ‘optionality,’” or dimensionality, Buchholz adds\n\n“This is the quantum decade,” says Konstantinos Karagiannis, director, Quantum Computing Services at Silicon Valley consultant Protiviti. “The uses aren’t as far away as most people think.”\n\nOne type of proto-quantum computer already in use is the “quantum annealer.” Annealers work hand in hand with classical computers to solve optimization problems like routing trucks or assembling factories. But this is just a taste of things to come, especially when gate-based “universal” QC machines pioneered by IBM, IonQ and others reach the market. “Those are the ones that have the potential one day to crack encryption and do some of those bad things,” Karagiannis adds, “but also to change the world, because quantum machine learning will run better on them.”\n\nProtiviti is now employing a gate-based quantum computer for fraud detection, a typical ML classification use case. “There are only a handful of machines on the cloud that are powerful enough to do it. You have to wait for your turn to run it,” says Karagiannis.\n\nPossible Eco Benefits\n\nThe field appears to be well funded. Venture capital firms alone invested more than $1 billion into the sector in 2021, according to Deloitte, which says the industries likely to gain first from the technology include pharmaceuticals, chemicals (catalysts, more eco-friendly feedstocks), automotive (optimized factory-robot motions) and finance (investment portfolio optimization).\n\nQC offers potential ecological benefits too: Quantum computers using “quality” qubits (still not commonly available) could make high-level computing dramatically more energy efficient, according to Interesting Engineering. “There are tasks for which the quantum computer could spend one hundred times less energy than the best current supercomputers.”\n\nQuantum-enabled AI also has a national security aspect. Some believe China has gotten the jump on the US and other Western nations in the AI race, and Bloomberg reported in mid-October that the US may soon place export controls on AI and QC technologies. Others worry that QC could one day break the algorithm used for the public-key encryption that allows secure transmission of email and much of modern communications.\n\nQuantum-Enabled AI\n\nWhile use cases involving universal QC are still rare, more companies announced AI/QC initiatives in the past year. LG Electronics is exploring QC for big data, IoT, AI, robotics and other applications that, LG notes, all require processing a large amount of data. Meanwhile, HSBC is also looking at QC for investment portfolio optimization, risk mitigation and fraud detection, which typically use ML algorithms to process large amounts of data.\n\nThis is the first technology that is truly exponential, says Karagiannis. Many people today are familiar with Moore’s Law, which roughly states that computer power doubles every two years. But Moore’s Law pales beside QC’s projected growth curve, where a system’s power doubles every time a single qubit is added. “[If] someone has a 100-qubit machine and then someone else has a 200-qubit machine, that’s many, many orders of magnitude more powerful, not just double,” Karagiannis explains.\n\nBuilding on the success of its 127-qubit Eagle, IBM in 2023 will deliver the Condor, “the world’s first universal quantum processor with over 1,000 qubits,” according to the company, and a 4,000+ qubit processor by 2025.\n\nNot surprisingly, obstacles remain before these science fiction-like capabilities can be realized. A quantum computer is not just a scaled-up version of today’s supercomputers. “It’s something very different,” says Deloitte’s Buchholz. “We are attempting to constrain individual atoms and particles to behave in a regimented fashion, which is not their natural state.” They need to be interconnected, contained and constrained, something “unthinkable” a decade ago.\n\n“Some approaches to quantum machine learning introduce completely novel ways to do machine learning that do not have a classical analogue,” says Vedran Dunjko, associate professor at the Netherlands’ Leiden University. But many of these “novel” uses are many years away—and may never be realized. In terms of first applications, Dunjko anticipates use cases close to quantum technologies, as in the development of exotic materials.\n\nGerman conglomerate Bosch also believes that quantum computers may soon offer “a significant advantage over conventional computers in discovering and designing new materials” for products like fuel cells, batteries, electric engines or advanced sensors. “Classical computers are not able to calculate the properties of these materials with sufficient accuracy,” the company commented recently in announcing its new partnership with IBM to develop quantum algorithms for industrial applications.\n\nAerospace firms are watching developments closely too. “Harnessing quantum technologies for the aerospace industry is one of the great challenges we face in the coming years,” commented Greg Hyslop, Boeing’s chief engineer and executive vice president of engineering, testing and technology, in discussing Boeing’s $5 million gift for faculty research in quantum science.\n\n“The emergence of some small-scale prototypes of QC has already propelled the development of post-quantum cryptography,” says Takaya Miyano, a professor of mechanical engineering at Japan’s Ritsumeikan University. He expects to see the first practical uses of QC for cryptography and the military as well as pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe US-China Rivalry\n\n“AI and quantum computing are among the most important technologies for the next decade and beyond,” Jonathan Panikoff, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Geoeconomics Center and director of its Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, tells Global Finance. AI and QC are also “very likely to underlie portions of US-China competition for the coming decades as well.”\n\nAdmittedly, it may take time before this all plays out. Devices like China’s powerful 66-qubit Zuchongzhi processor “are not capable of universal quantum computation and cannot play a role in such geopolitical struggles,” Marek Narozniak, a physicist and member of a quantum research group at New York University, tells Global Finance.\n\nStill, in one study, Chinese researchers found that Zuchongzhi was able to complete a sampling task in 1.2 hours that they estimated would have required a 2019 classical supercomputer 8.2 years to complete. But even study co-author Chao-Yang Lu acknowledged that the sample task completed had no practical value, adding that “the computational problems that can truly benefit from quantum computing are still quite limited,” as quoted in Physics World.\n\nGovernments are paying attention too. In May, a US National Security Memorandum flagged the potential “risks of quantum computers to the nation’s cyber, economic and national security,” and directed US agencies to begin a “multiyear process of migrating vulnerable computer systems to quantum-resistant cryptography.”\n\nThat White House memo “accurately captured the challenges quantum computing could pose to Western interests across the economy, finance, infrastructure and national security sectors,” Panikoff comments, while adding that “quantum computing and its uses, including for nefarious purposes, is still in its infancy and developing.”\n\nMuch Fanfare, Little Utility\n\nWhat about critics like Oxford University physicist Nikita Gourianov, who recently wrote in the Financial Times that “the quantum computing industry has yet to demonstrate any practical utility, despite the fanfare”?\n\n“There have not yet been any clear demonstrations of practical utility,” answers Boeing’s Toups. The critics have a point. “However, based on our investigations, we see great promise to eventually be able to use quantum computers to make practical improvements that will dramatically improve our products and services.”\n\n“Those quotes always baffle me,” comments Karagiannis “There are about 140 companies that are currently using D-Wave [quantum annealers] in real business applications daily.”\n\nIn a test run, Volkswagen used live access to a D-Wave quantum processor to optimize the painting process in one of its factories.\n\n“For example,” a case report by D-Wave Systems explains, “if a small subset of minivans was slated to be painted black rather than white, the algorithm would specifically assign those paint jobs to minivans falling within stretches of the production run where other vehicles are already being painted black.”\n\nVolkswagen later reported, “We managed to reduce the color switches in the entire sequence significantly.”\n\nStill, as noted, D-Wave machines, which debuted in 2011, are basically analog computers, “meaning they only tackle one specific problem,” Samuel Mugel, CTO at Multiverse Computing, a quantum software development company, tells Global Finance. “They are not equivalent to universal quantum computers, which can tackle any problem.” And regarding the latter, the technology isn’t ready for mainstream industrial use, as even Karagiannis acknowledges.\n\n“Right now, we’re in the ‘noisy’ intermediate-scale quantum era,” Karagiannis says. “The qubits interfere with each other. The support circuitry interferes. It’s really hard … It’s hard to get these machines to stay in a behaving state.”\n\nBut the buzz is rising. “It’s almost inevitable that there will be under- and overselling as we transition from research to engineering to application,” adds Deloitte’s Buchholz.\n\n“It is easy to be a naysayer and negative these days,” says Dunjko. He prefers to focus on how far QC has evolved since he began working in this area in 2010. “Even if technology continues just linearly, we will have tremendous devices.”\n\nTechnology does not advance linearly, of course. Progress is more a stop-and-start affair. “Creative new ideas cause disruptive jumps,” Dunjko adds, so when projecting the long-term impact of quantum-enabled AI, some intellectual humility may be in order.\n\n“In the same way that it was impossible to understand the impact of digitalization in the 1960s or the internet in the 1990s, we have only the barest inklings today of what might be possible,” Buchholz says.\n\nLink to Global Finance's articlehere."

        "content": "Investment into European quantum computing startups is booming. According to data from Dealroom, they raised over $290m in 2022, almost double their total from the previous year. And this year could be a whole lot bigger.\n\nWhile companies likeIQM(one of Europe’s largest quantum startups) focus on developing the hardware for quantum computers, others are focusing on making the technology accessible to businesses.\n\nQuantum-as-a-service startups give clients access to quantum computing, often through cloud services. And their popularity has taken off fast.\n\n“Two years ago they didn’t know where to even get started with quantum computing. Now we see more and more companies with existing quantum experience in-house,” says Ilana Wisby, CEO of Oxford Quantum Circuits — the first startup to offer cloud access to its quantum computers in Europe through Amazon Web Services.\n\nQuantum computers are still in early stages of development — the largest quantum processors just havea few hundred qubits(the quantum equivalent of a classical computer bit) and the technology is still prone to calculation errors. But that isn’t deterring big players from using the technology now.\n\n“Quantum computing is inevitable, and people know it will impact their businesses. They want to be ready and have a first-mover advantage when more powerful quantum computing hardware becomes available,” Wisby says.\n\nThe quantum computers that exist today have limited capacity, but they’re already being put to use to help companies with some of the biggest problems they face.\n\nFinance is one of the biggest applications for quantum computing. Experts are hoping that the technology can optimise investment portfolios and boost returns by millions.\n\nSwiss company Terra Quantum has developed quantum algorithms that can optimise portfolios of collateral investments. Compared to classical approaches, the algorithm was 10 times faster and improved the portfolio’s performance by six basis points — for a European bank posting €400bn in collateral, that would translate to a return around €240m a year better, says Terra Quantum’s CEO Markus Pflitsch.\n\n“The mainstream narrative is that quantum will only be disruptive in the future,” Pflitsch tells Sifted. “But we are already in a position to tackle meaningful use cases today.”\n\nLike many other quantum providers, Terra Quantum uses a hybrid approach that combines quantum and classical algorithms to make the most of what each type of computer is best at doing. This allows the company to get faster, more accurate results than using just classical computers.\n\nQuantum algorithms are particularly good at optimisation problems. For example, Terra Quantum is working on a pilot programme helping a logistics company optimise the routes of fleets comprising thousands of trucks — which may be able to significantly reduce CO2 emissions.\n\n“Logistics, aerospace, energy companies… all industries require solutions for large optimisation problems,” says Marta Estarellas, senior quantum engineer at Qilimanjaro, a Spanish quantum-as-a-service startup.\n\nClassical computers take too long to solve these problems, meaning that companies often have to settle for simplifying their optimisation problems and obtaining less accurate results. “With a quantum computer the solution is exact, not an approximation,” Estarellas tells Sifted.\n\nAnother application of quantum computing is “predictive maintenance” — Spanish quantum startupMultiverse Computinghas been working with Bosch to predict where supply chains are going to fail and optimise when and where maintenance is needed. The company is also using this approach to help a hospital in Barcelona predict which patients are going to require attention in the next 20 minutes and optimise the use of its ICU beds.\n\nTo democratise access to quantum computing, Multiverse Computing has developed a platform called Singularity that can perform quantum computations from a spreadsheet, says CEO Enrique Lizaso.\n\n“If you are a financial analyst, you want to use this tool without having to learn about quantum computing, pay for a quantum computer or allocate any extra time or resources to it,” he tells Sifted.\n\nQuantum computing can also increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms and significantly reduce themassive amounts of energythey require to sort through data. According to Lizaso, quantum computing has the potential to run machine learning algorithms with 25 times less electricity.\n\nRead full article by Siftedhere."

Overall funding into European startupsfellfrom $62.3bn in H1 2022 to $32.1bn in H2 (as of December 20), while in Spain the figure fell from $2bn to $1.5bn in the same period, according todatafrom Dealroom.\n\nThis was helped along by some chunky raises in the latter half of the year, like HR software builderFactorial’s $120m Series C,which saw the company hit unicorn status.

The algorithm’s efficiency is derived from the combination of two approaches to enable continuous optimization – encoding qubits with three continuous variables and quantum state tomography. The algorithm makes use of all the powerful features of quantum computers: entanglement, superpositions, and now continuous encoding.\n\n“We will still be able to use these types of algorithms once we have fault-tolerant computers,” Orus said. “Quantum computers with more qubits and advanced error correction will only increase the accuracy, quality and the speed of the solution.”\n\n\n\nAbout Multiverse Computing\n\nMultiverse Computingis a leading quantum software company that applies quantum and quantum-inspired solutions to tackle complex problems in finance to deliver value today and enable a more resilient and prosperous economy.

        "content": "Según cuenta la leyenda, muchas de las punteras compañías de Silicon Valley que hoy dominan el panorama tecnológico surgieron en un humilde garaje. Pues, la donostiarra Multiverse Computing dio un paso más, y es que nació nada menos que en un grupo de whatsapp. Sucedió hace cuatro años y desde entonces su crecimiento ha sido exponencial. Entre sus logros está el de convencer a la propia Comisión Europea de que la startup con sede en Miramon tiene la llave para situar a Europa a la cabeza de la carrera en lo que a computación cuántica se refiere. “En este momento la computación cuántica está en plena expansión y nosotros no solo teníamos la certeza de que podíamos competir a escala global, sino que podíamos hacerlo mejor que nuestros competidores”, explica a este periódico uno de sus fundadores, el físico teórico Román Orús, quien también es profesor de Investigación Ikerbasque en el Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC).\n\nLa realidad es que el equipo formado por Orús, junto con Enrique Lizaso, Sam Mugel y Alfonso Rubio, ha convertido Multiverse Computing en la principal startup del sector en el Estado, logrando en 2021 unos ingresos de 6,8 millones de euros, lo cual ha posibilitado que la joven compañía inaugure nuevas sedes en París y Munich, además de las oficinas que tiene en Donostia y Toronto (Canadá).

        "date": "November 29, 2022",
        "content": "Artificial vision is everywhere in our lives. You can find it in automated passport scans at airports, security systems for your smartphone, and even in parking lots to read your license plate. Computers are constantly watching us, and this is not a bad thing. This sort of “Big Brother” system allows computerized systems to take decisions quickly and efficiently, saving a lot of human time and effort in complex tasks.\n\nComputer vision is also relevant to a manufacturing production line for the same reasons. Imagine a factory that produces wheels for cars. The quality assessment of the wheels could be done manually by an employee, but this also can be done by computerized artificial vision systems. Such systems are able to detect the tiniest of fractures and irregularities in the wheel. Computer vision is a key element of production lines in factories today.\n\nAlthough artificial vision provides some advantages to improving production, the current technology is not sophisticated enough for advanced fabrication lines. One challenge is low-quality images due to older camera hardware, poor lighting, vibrations, and factors present in most manufacturing facilities. In addition, an artificial vision system typically needs a very high level of accuracy to detect defects, as well as the ability to explain the results. Imagine going to your boss saying that you don’t know why a machine rejected a part!\n\nMultiverse Computing,a provider of value-based quantum computing solutions, has run a pilot project together with manufacturing companyIkerlanto assess the performance of quantum computer vision in detecting defects of pieces in factory production lines.\n\nQuantum computers are the holy grail in algorithmic science: They hold the promise of faster, more efficient, and more accurate calculations compared with today’s conventional computers because they manipulate information according to the laws of quantum physics. Quantum computing algorithms can detect anomalies in subtle patterns of data that a conventional computer would never be able to find. Quantum computers are also able to extract more information with less data,as proven in an article recently published in Nature Communications.\n\nThe Multiverse Computing and Ikerlan teams have demonstrated that today’s quantum computers, despite their hardware limitations, perform better than classical computer vision systems in finding defects in manufacturing images. The results,published in a research paper on arXiv, show that quantum computing vision outperforms classical counterparts in precision, even while maintaining the training and inference times of the algorithms. From a broader perspective, this is one of the first landmark results showing that quantum computers can offer real business value for the industry today for certain specific applications.\n\nMultiverse and Ikerlan used a dataset of 2,727 X-ray images of automotive parts with and without casting defects to train a quantum artificial vision system toseewhether an image has a defect or not. This is an incredibly hard task for computer vision systems due to the low quality of some images and the intricacy of defects, but it is the necessary first step to pinpoint flaws like a tiny fracture in a car wheel that could eventually lead to an accident. The study concluded that some of today’s commercial quantum computers can run quantum classification algorithms that systematically detect such defects with higher accuracy (between 10% and 20% more) than traditional explainable machine-learning methods, and with similar inference time. Multiverse algorithms were also explainable, in the sense that a human could understand the reasons behind the decisions made by the algorithm. This is a must in many industrial applications.\n\nIn addition to outperforming classical computers, these quantum algorithms from Multiverse learned to spot defects faster than other advanced algorithms currently being tested.\n\nWhen compared withthe best deep-learning algorithms by Amazon Solutions Lab, researchers found that the Multiverse/Ikerlan quantum algorithm obtained essentially the same accuracy but was 24× faster to train, with the time required going from almost two-and-a-half hours to less than six minutes. This speedup is key in environments where the algorithm must adapt to different circumstances on the fly. So overall, not only are the quantum vision systems explainable but more accurate than their classical counterparts and significantly faster than deep learning.\n\nThe results from the Multiverse and Ikerlan collaboration are the first example of a quantum computer vision system applied to a manufacturing line. These findings prove that quantum computing has quality control value in factories today. This is only the tip of the iceberg: Next time you go through an automated passport control, there might be some quantum physics behind the analysis!\n\n\n\nPlease find the original article by EE Times Europehere"

As quantum computers use algorithms to run multiple calculations at once, they can produce results at a faster rate, which is crucial for the trading that happens at a rapid pace in the stock markets. The answers that quantum computers give are also unique from classical computers, giving other advantages. “Like quantum physics, they are probabilistic rather than deterministic,” explained a 2020 article from McKinsey& Company. “[This means] that they can vary even when the input is the same.” These various inputs are especially important for optimization problems, financial simulations, fraud detection, and market prediction, all processes that banks and other financial institutions utilize on a daily basis.\n\nRead the full article by inside Quantum Technologyhere."

        "content": "Toronto, Canada –April 14, 2022–Multiverse Computing, a global leader in quantum computing solutions for the financial industry and beyond with offices in Toronto and Spain, today announced it has completed a proof-of-concept project with the Bank of Canada through which the parties used quantum computing to simulate the adoption of cryptocurrency as a method of payment by non-financial firms.\n\n“We are proud to be a trusted partner of the first G7 central bank to explore modelling of complex networks and cryptocurrencies through the use of quantum computing,” said Sam Mugel, CTO at Multiverse Computing. “The results of the simulation are very intriguing and insightful as stakeholders consider further research in the domain. Thanks to the algorithm we developed together with our partners at the Bank of Canada, we have been able to model a complex system reliably and accurately given the current state of quantum computing capabilities.”\n\nCompanies may adopt various forms of payments. So, it’s important to develop a deep understanding of interactions that can take place in payments networks.\n\nMultiverse Computing conducted its innovative work related to applying quantum computing for modelling complex economic interactions in a research project with the Bank of Canada. The project explored quantum computing technology as a way to simulate complex economic behaviour that is otherwise very difficult to simulate using traditional computational techniques.\n\nBy implementing this solution using D-Wave’s annealing quantum computer, the simulation was able to tackle financial networks as large as 8-10 players, with up to 2^90 possible network configurations. Note that classical computing approaches cannot solve large networks of practical relevance as a 15-player network requires as many resources as there are atoms in the universe.\n\n“We wanted to test the power of quantum computing on a research case that is hard to solve using classical computing techniques,” said Maryam Haghighi, Director, Data Science at the Bank of Canada. “This collaboration helped us learn more about how quantum computing can provide new insights into economic problems by carrying out complex simulations on quantum hardware.”\n\nMotivated by the empirical observations about the cooperative nature of adoption of cryptocurrency payments, this theoretical study found that for some industries, these digital assets would share the payments market with traditional bank transfers and cash-like instruments. The market share for each would depend on how the financial institutions respond to the cryptocurrency adoptions, and on the economic costs associated with such trades.\n\nThe quantum simulations helped generate examples that illustrate how similar firms may end up adopting different levels of cryptocurrency use."

        "content": "On this International Women’s Day, March 8, Multiverse Computing is proud to make public its commitment to gender diversity in its hiring practises. As efforts to recruit top talent in quantum algorithm development intensify, the company is doubling down onthe recruitment of womenas its growth continues to accelerate.\n\nRecent hires have raised the proportion of women within Multiverse’s workforce to nearly a third, with the majority working in STEM roles (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). That ratio has been steadily increasing and will rise further over the coming months as recruitment continues, the company says. Comparatively, a 2020 study from Interference Advisors has shown that the industry average for female representation in quantum startups has typically been about 10 percent.\n\nWith this in mind, Multiverse Computing has taken the important step of creating a Gender Equality Committee, uncommon among technology startups. The committee is tasked with designing a plan to prioritize the recruitment of women and ensuring gender equality in the treatment of staff to assure the company is a highly attractive employer to all.\n\n“The committee will be responsible for guiding the continuity of our welcoming work environment. This includes activities like yoga and outdoor sports, as well as employee support programs such as mental health workshops,” said Enrique Lizaso Olmos, CEO at Multiverse Computing. “We are also giving our female employees additional visibility through corporate videos and media, as well as speaking opportunities at international conferences.”\n\nIndustry data has shown that about60 percent of women believe they do not have equal career opportunitiescompared to men in the quantum field. Multiverse Computing believes it is crucial to combat this by creating a culture where women are valued and empowered, and feel supported to take risks and lead innovation. This open and collaborative spirit is one of the company’s core beliefs and has helped Multiverse along every step of its journey thus far, according to Olmos.\n\nOne exceptional young woman who joined the Multiverse team last year is Quantum Software Developer Cristina Sanz. She was recently honored with the “Builder of the Year Award” for 2021 at theWomen in Quantum Awardspresented at the Q2B conference in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\n“I’m glad to be recognized for my work of course, but the most important part of these awards is to increase the visibility of women in quantum,” said Sanz. “This is how we will encourage more girls to study STEM subjects, and eventually work in quantum. If they see that women like me can achieve these things, it will give more young women the confidence they need to follow this path toward a career in quantum too.”\n\nAs Multiverse continues its international expansion, increased diversity in its workforce is not only the company’s chosen path, but it is also inevitable for business reasons and in the name of equality. Furthermore, a McKinsey report has stated that diverse and inclusive companies are 35 percent more likely to outperform their competitors. Meanwhile, the Harvard Business Review writes that diverse companies are 70 percent more likely to capture new markets."

The project involves a public-private collaboration between companies, research centers and universities to accelerate the implementation of these technologies for use in the medium term.\n\nAdditionally, the project should assist in identifying a series of relevant use cases in the Spanish economy to conduct proofs of concept to study whether quantum computing could improve the performance of classical computing to respond to business needs while proposing the corresponding metrics. In this context, use cases will be investigated in Earth observation, the environment and the fight against climate change, the traceability of information throughout the supply chain, the optimization and simulation of complex financial calculations, signal intelligence, etc.\n\nQuantum technologies, and specifically quantum computing, is set to play a disruptive role due to the impact it will have in many areas, given the capacity for massive calculation, which could mark a new technological era. Spain cannot be left behind, and it has to be able to lead this new race.\n\nOne of the objectives of the project is to position the consortium and its companies as benchmarks in quantum computing in their application sectors, allowing their participation in international initiatives such as theQuantum Flagship,Horizonte Europa,Digital Europe, or theEuropean Defense Fund.\n\nThrough the research in quantum computing that will be undertaken, theCUCOproject will also have an impact on improving environmental sustainability since quantum computing enables more energy-efficient algorithms.\n\n\n\n"

Ellos se dedican a otra de las grandes promesas tecnológicas:la computación cuántica, esa disciplina que promete desarrollar ordenadores capaces de resolver en mucho menor tiempo y con menor consumo energético los problemas que se le atragantan a las supercomputadoras, que supuestamente tienen más problemas a la hora de abordar ingentes cantidades de datos.\n\nUn carro, el de la computación cuántica, al que ahora se quiere sumar el Gobierno español, que anunció esta semana una inversión de 22 millones de euros paradesarrollar el primer equipo de esta naturaleza del sur de Europa,que podría estar listo para finales del próximo año. “Nosotros no estamos en esas. Lo nuestro es la parte del ‘software’. La del ‘hardware’, con los gigantes estadounidenses que hay metidos, es una carrera imposible”, remata su compañero Enrique Lizaso, CEO de la firma.\n\nSu obsesión por hacer digerible algo tan denso como esta rama de la informática se deja ver en sus explicaciones, masticadas para ser asimiladas por el común de los mortales. Por supuesto, este empeño se nota y mucho en cómo empaquetansus algoritmos cuánticos que pueden gobernarse desde una hoja de Excelsin tener el más mínimo conocimiento de la materia. “Diseñamos una extensión para las hojas de cálculo, que al final es lo que se utiliza en el sector financiero, donde están nuestros principales clientes.

Banks can already get a 100-fold advantage by using quantum computers to solve problems such as portfolio optimisation and fraud detection fraud, says Spanish startup Multiverse Computing.\n\nThe company, which raised a €10m seed funding round today, has developed a quantum software product that it is supplying to customers including BBVA, Bankia the European Tax Agency and the Bank of Canada.\n\n“It depends on the problem you are trying to solve,” says Enrique Lizaso, chief executive. “For some problems like optimising investment portfolios and machine learning to detect banking fraud, quantum computers can already outperform classical computers today.”\n\nTasks like these can be done 100 times faster using quantum rather than classical computers, even though today’s quantum computers are still relatively limited,with less than 100 qubits and high error rates.\n\nGoldman Sachs — which has been working with quantum startup QCWare to test out practical applications has estimated that it wouldtake machines with 7500 qubitsand five more years— for quantum computing to be of practical use to the financial services industry. Jeremy O’Brien, CEO of photonic quantum computing company PsiQuantum, says quantum computersmust reach 1m qubits— something he believes is a decade away— to be useful.\n\nHowever, by focusing on problems that are particularly well suited to quantum computers, Multiverse says it is possible to get quantum advantage even with today’s small, error-prone machines.\n\nRead full article by Siftedhere"

The good news is that this is changing,slowly. Many women now hold jobs in the engineering, software and hardware fields for some of the bigger players like Google, Microsoft and IBM etc. Yet, it’s not just the multinationals that are playing their part, startups are doing what needs to be done, too.\n\nTQDhas come up with a list of 52 women working as engineers or in positions requiring technical competence in quantum computing (QC) startups. The list, as usual, is non-exhaustive — it’s just a general map of what it’s like out there, a rough compass to how women are changing the QC landscape.\n\nA shout-out first must go to companies like 1QBit, ColdQuanta, HQS Quantum Simulations, Qilimanjaro Quantum Tech, and Riverlane for having three or more women on their books in these positions (or from what we know about). Okay, we know these figures look insignificant compared to the women Google and the other multinationals employ as engineers, butTQDbelieves they have a great inclusive attitude that is great for the industry.\n\nBecause of this, the last four entries, 49–52, have been dedicated to women working for the Big Companies, though we realize the figure is many, many times higher. I omitted them as I didn’t want a list as long as The Yellow Brick Road and I sometimes like to sleep.\n\nPublished inthequantumdaily.\n\nContinue reading"

While experts believe that it will take 10-20 or more years to solve quantum computing’s engineering challenges and take the technology mainstream, many F.I.s are investing in technologies now with a ten or more year lifespan. This potential implementation overlap makes investing quantum standards and technology critical. Developing a quantum strategy will be key for all F.I.’s over the next three years to future proof their investments, data security and maintain pace with innovative players in the industry.\n\nAs published inCapco."

Dynamic portfolio optimization is well known to be NP-Hard and is central to quantitative finance.\n\n\n\nRoman and his team have implemented a number of quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms on different hardware platforms to solve its discrete formulation using real data from daily prices over 8 years of 52 assets, providing a detailed comparison of the obtained Sharpe ratios, profits and computing times. His team has applied classical solvers (Gekko, exhaustive), D-Wave Hybrid quantum annealing, two different approaches based on Variational Quantum Eigensolvers on IBM-Q (one of them brand-new and tailored to the problem), and for the first time in this context, a quantum-inspired optimizer based on Tensor Networks.\n\n\n\nRoman will share his conclusions on which specific hardware platform can handle the largest systems with calculations up to 1272 fully-connected qubits for demonstrative purposes. He will also discuss how to mathematically implement other possible real-life constraints, sharing several ideas to further improve the performance of the studied methods.\n\nClick here for theYouTubevideo."

It was an early adopter of everything from mainframe computers to artificial intelligence (see timeline). For most of the past decade more trades have been done at high frequency by complex algorithms than by humans. Now big banks have their eyes on quantum computing, another cutting-edge technology.\n\nThis is the idea, developed by physicists in the 1980s, that the counter-intuitive properties of quantum mechanics might allow for the construction of computers that could perform mathematical feats that no non-quantum machine would ever be capable of. The promise is now starting to be realised. Computing giants like Google and ibm, as well as a flock of smaller competitors, are building and refining quantum hardware.\n\nQuantum computers will not beat their classical counterparts at everything. But much of the maths at which they will excel is of interest to bankers. At a conference on December 10th William Zeng, head of quantum research at Goldman Sachs told the audience that quantum computing could have a “revolutionary” impact on the bank, and on finance more broadly.\n\nCONTINUE READING"

And while the processing power of these classical computers has come a long way, a vastly different computing technology involving quantum mechanics has been steadily developing since the early 1980s. Known as quantum computing, this technology is now gathering growing interest for its superior performance compared with classical computing, meaning that it is set to have hugely significant ramifications for applications across many different industries. And with some of the world’s most-renowned financial institutions recently linking up with quantum-computing companies to gain the early-mover advantage, it would seem that anticipation over this potentially transformational emerging technology within the financial-services industry is only just beginning to heat up.\n\nContinue reading"

Pero en ese camino hay unaetapa intermedia vitalpara el desarrollo de cualquier investigación. Si lapatentefalla, todo el esfuerzo y dinero invertido en el proceso puede acabar en la basura o, peor, en manos de la competencia.\n\nEl sistema de patentes combina una serie de requisitos técnicos y legales y es, en definitiva, el sello que permite a una empresa o gobiernodesarrollar en exclusiva un producto. Se trata de un ámbito bastante complejo al que las grandes compañías dedican cada vez más recursos por aquello de poder sacar ventaja a la competencia en un mercado global cada vez más interconectado.\n\nNo extraña por tanto que la entidad que más solicitudes de patente realizó el año pasado en Euskadi seaAutotech Engineering, el ecosistema de innovación de la multinacionalGestamp. Con un total de 25 solicitudes el grupo que encabeza Francisco Riberas fue el tercero con más actividad en este terreno a nivel nacional, solo por detrás deAmadeusy el propioConsejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), que como es lógico es el que más nuevas patentes aglutina con mucha diferencia sobre el resto, según los datos desvelados este jueves en la jornada IP Perspectives Euskadi que organiza la firmaABG Intellectual Property.\n\nEl ránking aporta pistas sobre el impulso innovador de los diferentes territorios y el tejido empresarial vasco sale muy bien parado. De hecho Euskadi aglutina tres de las cinco entidades que más patentes solicitaron el año pasado a nivel europeo, quedando en cuarto y quinto lugar la fundaciónTecnalia, con 20, yMultiverse Computing, la prestigiosa firma guipuzcoana líder europea en computación cuántica, con 16.\n\nEl volumen total de patentes presentadas a laOficina Europea de Patentesel año pasado por parte de empresas o centros tecnológicos vascos ascendió a 255, un 13,8% más, lo que supone alcanzar un nuevo máximo anual. Con algo más de 115 patentes por habitante Euskadi presenta los números más altos en este ámbito muy por delante de Madrid o Cataluña (la media en España son 40 patentes por habitante al año). Aunque existe un sistema de protección de la propiedad industrial propio de cada país, cada vez más empresas están optando por la cobertura europea.\n\nSiguiendo con el top 10 de entidades con más patentes en España, en el octavo lugar se encuentra laUPV/EHU, con 14 en 2022. La universidad pública vasca se sitúa por delante por ejemplo de la Universitat de Barcelona o la Universitat Politécnica de Valencia. Es decir, Gestamp, Tecnalia, Multiverse y la UPV/EHU sumaron el año pasado cerca de un tercio de todas las solicitudes de patentes de Euskadi.\n\nEl volumen de patentes es un indicativo del impulso investigador aunque no todas ellas acaban desembocando en productos que acaban en el mercado. Se estima que en torno a una cuarta parte de las patentes acaban llegando a licenciarse, es decir, acaban siendo compradas por empresas para desarrollar productos, si bien en el caso de loscentros de investigación vascosel porcentaje es algo más alto.\n\nEuskadi fue considerada la regiónmás innovadora de España en el último informe RIS de la Comisión Europea. El ecosistema de parques y centros tecnológicos y el tejido productivo vascos están en el puesto 72 de un total de 240 regiones europeas después de avanzar Euskadi 50 posiciones en apenas cuatro años en esta clasificación.\n\nFull articlehere"

Multiverse acaba de dar la campanada al auparse al Top10 de empresas españolas por solicitudes de patente europea, con 16 en 2022.\n\nEn realidad, la cosa viene de lejos, esta startup de 10 millones de euros de facturación suma ya 60 patentes, la mitad de ellas las ha registrado en Estados Unidos y la otra mitad en Europa. Sólo hay dos despachos especializados en el mundo, por cierto, en la protección de innovaciones cuánticas, uno en Norteamérica y el otro en Reino Unido, el sector legal tiene que aprender mucho de tecnología para competir en este nuevo escenario.\n\nMultiverse superó el año pasado en patentes a una de las dos empresas del Ibex que aún resiste en ese Top10 nacional, Telefónica, descabalgada ya sorprendentemente Repsol (¿ni siquiera ya 12 patentes al año?). Amadeus mantiene el honor del grupo de grandes cotizadas con 39. Pero el fenómeno Multiverse resulta interesante por otros motivos.\n\nEsta empresa es la mayor de Europa y la tercera del mundo en su sector, cosa que nos devuelve la esperanza de hablar con voz propia en las tecnologías cuánticas, vista nuestra ausencia de la carrera de los materiales y el hardware. Consuela saber también que IBM está asegurando que su ordenador cuántico de San Sebastián podría alcanzar los 4.000 qbits antes de 2030. Pero sobre todo el ascenso de Amadeus y Multiverse pone de manifiesto el impresionante balanceo de la innovación hacia el software de los últimos años.\n\nLa tendencia resulta muy visible en el sector que está viviendo más intensamente la confluencia del mundo físico y el digital: la automoción. Si en 2010 aproximadamente el 26% de las innovaciones en los grandes fabricantes (OEM) estaban centradas en las áreas de conectividad, ADAS (sistemas avanzados de ayuda a la conducción) e interfaces digitales, una década después el porcentaje es significativamente superior, del 55%.\n\nPatentar software no es sencillo. En los grandes despachos especializados la rama legal suele decantarse por proteger el código por la vía de la propiedad intelectual, como una obra literaria, mientras que la rama técnica suele preferir la vía de la propiedad industrial. Uno de los recursos a los que suelen acudir las empresas es al registro de los algoritmos bajo la fórmula de lo que se conoce como verosimilitud de hardware. Es un asunto, en fin, que la regulación debería resolver con urgencia de una vez por todas.\n\nArtículo de Forbes disponibleaquí."

        "content": "Sin embargo, la revelación de estos datos viene siempre acompañada de sentimientos encontrados, y esta vez no ha sido una excepción. Por un lado, las 1.925 solicitudes de patentes europeas presentadas por empresas e inventores españoles son una buena cifra si tenemos en cuenta que son solo 20 por debajo del máximo histórico nacional que se logró en el ejercicio anterior. Ahora bien, el total global ha crecido un 2,5%.\n\nMás allá del inútil debate sobre qué ciudad o comunidad autónoma ha realizado el mayor número de solicitudes de patente, hay un horizonte que nos sitúa como el undécimo país europeo (contando Reino Unido) por volumen de presentaciones. Y esto siendo la cuarta economía de la eurozona. El sistema de patentes es indudablemente complejo, pero eso no es un problema para que Alemania supere las 24.000 solicitudes de patentes europeas en un año, mientras nosotros no llegamos a las 2.000.\n\nEn una materia íntimamente ligada a la internacionalización como es esta, ampliar las miras nos permite tomar conciencia de nuestro lugar. A nivel global, el mayor número de patentes solicitadas ante la OEP en 2022 estarían dentro del sector de la comunicación digital, un área con escaso peso en España. Las invenciones en tecnología médica, en cambio, ocupan el segundo puesto. En ese sector, nuestro país sí que mantiene una buena posición. De hecho, la innovación sanitaria es nuestro principal fuerte, con las invenciones farmacéuticas y biotecnológicas ocupando también los primeros puestos.\n\nMotivo de optimismo ha sido también constatar que las invenciones en tecnología ambiental son las que más han crecido, con un 82%. La preservación del medio ambiente es uno de los grandes retos a los que nos enfrentamos como sociedad y que el tejido innovador español esté comprometido con la búsqueda de soluciones para garantizar el acceso a una energía limpia es una apuesta elogiable e inteligente.\n\nLas cifras del pasado ejercicio nos muestran, además, un avance importante de la tecnología informática (crece un 35%) y, aunque a galaxias de distancia de las grandes potencias, que nuestra posición mejore es también motivo para el ánimo. De hecho, que entre los principales solicitantes españoles de patentes europeas se encuentre una empresa de ese sector, la donostiarra Multiverse Computing, resulta esperanzador no solo por el área, sino también por el hecho de que pertenezca al sector privado.\n\nAunque estemos acostumbrados a que el Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), universidades y otros centros de investigación figuren en los primeros puestos de presentaciones, sabemos que para que esas invenciones lleguen a la sociedad y se traduzcan en generación de empleos y riqueza, es necesaria la colaboración con un sector privado que es a menudo incapaz de satisfacer esas necesidades, ya sea por falta de conocimiento, de espíritu emprendedor o de tejido industrial, entre otras razones.\n\nArtículo completo por CincoDias (El País)aquí."

        "date": "April 17, 2023",
        "content": "Las tecnologías cuánticas —entendiendo como tales la computación cuántica, las comunicaciones cuánticas y los sensores cuánticos— tienen el potencial de transformar nuestras economías y nuestras sociedades. Algunos de estos cambios los podemos ver desde este lado del horizonte, y otros quizás ni siquiera somos capaces de imaginarlos ahora. Lo que somos capaces de ver desde la perspectiva que tenemos es que estas tecnologías pueden contribuir decisivamente a resolver algunos de los retos más importantes a los que nos enfrentamos.\n\nEstos retos se distribuyen a lo largo de un amplio espectro de industrias que van desde el sector financiero a la industria farmacéutica, pasando por las compañías de telecomunicaciones, energía, automovilísticas, logística y aeronáutica. Estas industrias son una muestra de las que van adelantadas en sus caminos cuánticos y que ya disponen de casos de uso identificados sobre los que están trabajando, tanto para realizar las primeras integraciones con las tecnologías cuánticas actualmente disponibles, como para ir preparando las que llegarán en el futuro.\n\n“Los casos de uso de las tecnologías cuánticas abarcan un amplio espectro de industrias, como por ejemplo la industria aeronáutica (Airbus), automovilística (BMW, Volkswagen) y el sector financiero (J. P. Morgan y Crédit Agricole)”, afirma Najwa Sidqi, gerente de transferencia de conocimiento para tecnologías cuánticas en Innovate UK KTN. “En mi opinión, es importante que las empresas exploren y analicen qué es útil de las tecnologías cuánticas para sus industrias”, añade. Sidqi nos hace ver que hay compañías que ya tienen una estrategia para las tecnologías cuánticas y que la están implementando. Y a la vista de ello: ¿Por qué necesitamos definir una estrategia empresarial para las tecnologías cuánticas?\n\nPara responder a esta pregunta, en una primera aproximación, podemos utilizar la conocida técnica matemática y lógica de la reducción al absurdo. Supongamos, entonces, que no necesitamos definir una estrategia empresarial para las tecnologías cuánticas. Esta hipótesis nos lleva casi automáticamente a los casos de las organizaciones que no siguen ninguna estrategia y, de seguirla, no contemplan las variables e impactos que introducen las tecnologías disruptivas en sus estrategias. Los resultados de estas organizaciones son claramente sub-óptimos cuando menos.\n\n“Como mínimo, las empresas deberían estar trazando una hoja de ruta de tecnologías cuánticas para sus organizaciones. Deberían estar definiendo las grandes preguntas: ¿Qué hará la cuántica por nosotros? ¿Cómo funcionará con nuestros sistemas clásicos? ¿Cuál de los problemas de negocio se alinearía con las capacidades cuánticas? ¿Cómo podemos realizar pilotos? ¿A qué proveedores debemos contactar para que nos ayuden?”, resalta Brian Lenahan, fundador y presidente del Quantum Strategy Institute.\n\nNecesitamos una estrategia empresarial y, específicamente, necesitamos una estrategia empresarial para las tecnologías cuánticas. Para profundizar en esta idea, vamos a ver en primer lugar los resultados de la reflexión estratégica en las organizaciones.\n\nDurante mis años como consultora de estrategia y operaciones, participé en ejercicios de reflexión estratégica, especialmente en el sector de las telecomunicaciones. A un alto nivel, estos ejercicios intentan de alguna forma predecir qué va a pasar en el futuro y qué significa eso para una compañía en concreto.\n\nEntonces sabíamos que iba a pasar —y de hecho ya estaba pasando— y que el uso del móvil iba a ser cada vez mayor, y que dicho uso se iba a basar en el consumo de datos. A partir de aquí, el reto era responder a las preguntas de negocio que esto implicaba para las empresas de telecomunicaciones, como, por ejemplo: ¿Esto significa una amenaza o una oportunidad? ¿Cómo podemos hacer frente a las amenazas? ¿Cómo podemos aprovechar las oportunidades? ¿Tendríamos que pensar en nuevos productos y servicios? Y, si es así, ¿en cuáles? ¿Qué impacto podríamos estimar que tiene todo esto en nuestra cuenta de pérdidas y ganancias? ¿De qué plazos estaríamos hablando? ¿Qué iniciativas tendríamos que lanzar? ¿Cómo las podríamos planificar?\n\nEstas preguntas constituyen el núcleo de los ejercicios de reflexión estratégica en las organizaciones. Y los resultados que las organizaciones obtienen al responder a estas preguntas tienen que ver con cómo abordan sus ejercicios y procesos de reflexión estratégica.\n\n¿Qué resultados, entonces, obtienen las empresas de sus ejercicios de reflexión estratégica? La verdad incómoda es que no tan buenos como sería de esperar. De hecho, se estima que las tasas de fallo en la implementación de la estrategia oscilan entre el 60 y el 90 por ciento3.\n\nEstos resultados son el producto de cómo las organizaciones abordan sus ejercicios y procesos de reflexión estratégica. Por lo general, las compañías realizan estos ejercicios con rigidez y una fuerte aversión a la incertidumbre.\n\n\n\nFull article by Esperanza Cuencahere."

        "content": "Pregunta: ¿Trate de explicar qué es este ordenador y qué significa?\n\nRespuesta:Los ordenadores convencionales tienen sus limitaciones, porque hay cosas que no pueden resolver. Y hay otros temas que resultan muy costosos: una ronda de entrenamiento del Chat GPT (la reciente y rompedora aplicación de Inteligencia Artificial), por ejemplo, son cuatro millones de euros en factura energética con ordenadores convencionales. Y todavía se equivoca. No es eficiente, ni sostenible.\n\nP: Es decir, el coche es la leche, pero consume mucha gasolina.\n\nR: Exacto, gasta demasiada gasolina. Y luego está el ordenador cuántico, que es otra forma de hacer ordenadores. Un ordenador cuántico procesa la información de forma diferente. Y eso hace que tenga una potencia de cálculo extraordinaria. Lo de la manzana que se cae del árbol, pues no vale. Aquí mandan las leyes de la física cuántica y éstas son muy raras. Y el resultado es que se pueden calcular cosas en un ordenador cuántico, que no se pueden hacer en un ordenador normal. Pero además, muchas de las cosas que haces en ordenadores normales, como por ejemplo todo este tema de Inteligencia Artificial, con un ordenador cuántico se puede mejorar en precisión, en velocidad, en eficiencia energética, etcétera.\n\nP: ¿Y cómo de bueno es este ordenador de IBM?\n\nR: Lo que va a venir aquí es uno de los primeros prototipos de la compañía más avanzada que tenemos en occidente, que es IBM. Y estos ordenadores cuánticos que tenemos ahora, para lo que nos gustaría tener, todavía son pequeños y ruidosos, pero ya son unas primeras máquinas con las que podemos empezar a hacer cosas muy potentes. Es una tecnología transversal. Es decir, el ordenador cuántico no es algo que vaya a sustituir a los ordenadores normales, sino que va a convivir con ellos. Pero sí sirve para determinados problemas o tareas que ahora mismo son muy duros de hacer computacionalmente.\n\nP: ¿Por ejemplo?\n\nR:Digamos que estamos mal acostumbrados, pero tú cuando te subes a tu coche y le pides a tu navegador calcular la ruta más corta desde el centro de Madrid a Barajas, dependiendo de los atascos, los radares, etcétera, calcular esa configuración es un problema muy duro. Controlar todo el tráfico aéreo, por ejemplo, es un problema complicadísimo. Pues para ese tipo de problemas, el ordenador cuántico vale.\n\nP: Ha mencionado la inteligencia artificial. ¿Estamos delegando muchas tareas en la IA? ¿Le preocupa esto o le emociona? ¿Qué opina?\n\nR: Esto de la inteligencia artificial le ha pillado un poco por sorpresa a todo el mundo, incluso a nosotros. Íbamos viendo que cada vez se iban haciendo más cosas, nosotros también estamos desarrollando algoritmos que pueden mejorar la IA convencional. Pero es cierto que el año pasado en los últimos seis meses hubo como un boom de aplicaciones.\n\nP:¿Hablamos de Chat GPT y similares?\n\nR: Antes ya habían salido algunas cosas para imágenes que eran muy sorprendentes, que te hacen deep fake (vídeos, imágenes o audios generados que imitan la apariencia y el sonido de una persona), pero cuando salieron los módulos de lenguaje era como espectacular, porque podías hablar con el ordenador. Desde el punto de vista de desarrollo era lo siguiente a hacer de forma natural, pero las consecuencias a las que ha llevado han sido completamente discontinuas.\n\nEcha un vistazo a la entrevista completa a Román Orús por Noticias de Gipuzkoaaquí."

        "content": "LLa “máquina” de IBM que llegará a Donostia el año que vienedentro del proyectoBasque Quantumno deja indiferente a nadie. Produce alegría, emoción y “vértigo” a partes iguales entre la comunidad científica guipuzcoana, aunque todavía es difícil adivinar para qué sirve un ordenador que, en una vorágine desarrolladora que enfrenta a gigantes de EEUU y China, principalmente, año tras año se ve superada en capacidad por una versión nueva y con más capacidad, medida en cúbits (bits cuánticos).\n\nRomán Orús, socio fundador y director científico de Multiverse Computing, empresa líder europea en software cuántico; y José María Pitarke, director del Centro de Investigación Científica Nanogune, nos dan algunas de las claves de esta apuesta de Euskadi y Gipuzkoa en particular.\n\nEsta vez sí; fallamos en los años 40\n\nLa carrera acaba de comenzar. Del mismo modo quelos vascos no estuvimos en la primera revolución tecnológica cuántica, cuando se inventó el transistor, en la década de los 40,ahora le hemos comprado a IBM un billete para subirnos al trendel desarrollo de la tecnología y la industria del futuro.\n\nEl famoso ordenador es uno de los seis más potentes que IBM tiene hoy en el mundo; en Europa, solo Alemania tiene el mismo privilegio, explica Orús.El procesador Eagle, que así se llama, tiene 127 cúbits, lo cual era un hito cuando fue presentado en noviembre de 2021. Sin embargo, el pasado noviembre (2022) se presentó otro (Osprey) con 433 cúbits y la propia marca americana, líder en el desarrollo de estos ordenadores, ha anunciado uno de 1.121 cúbits para este mismo año.Se cree que antes de 2030 se podría desarrollar una máquina de hasta un millón de cúbits. ¿De qué vale uno de 127 entonces? Pues de mucho, coinciden Orús y Pitarke.\n\nLa industria que “va a venir”\n\nEl ordenador que llegará a Donostia no es más que “un prototipo”, como los ordenadores convencionales gigantes que en la década de los años 40, hace 80 años, “ocupaban un edificio entero”. Pero al mismo tiempo, tiene mucho que ver con nuestro futuro, con lo que seremos mañana y el lugar que ocuparemos en el mundo. Para Gipuzkoa es un banco de pruebas de incalculable valor.\n\n“Esto es una industria que va a venir y aquí lo que se está haciendo es apostar porque este territorio sea uno de los focos principales de este nuevo tipo de industria, basada en tecnologías cuánticas. Y en ese aspecto, el caldo de cultivo ya estaba aquí:en Gipuzkoa hay mucha tradición industrial, mucho conocimiento académico, científico,tractor, pero faltaba algo que fuese más tangible y traer la máquina es algo muy bueno, porque es algo palpable”, asegura Román Orús.\n\nUna \"excusa\" para acelerar la investigación científica\n\n“La máquina en sí se acabará quedando obsoleta y habrá que cambiarla. Lo realmente importante es todo lo que va a generar alrededor. Es un catalizador, porque habrá gente que vendrá aquí solo porque está ese ordenador, se crearán nuevas iniciativas, arrancarán nuevas empresas, y se acelerará todo un ecosistema por haber puesto eso ahí. En realidad, la máquina es una excusa que va a acelerar el proceso”, añade este catalán afincado en Donostia desde su despacho en Miramon.\n\nTxema Pitarke, el director del CIC Nanogune, lo ve igual: “fortalecerá nuestra actividad investigadora en el desarrollo y en el uso de tecnologías cuánticas. Esto es una oportunidad para lograr un posicionamiento en una materia que está en auge y esto nos sitúa en el mapamundi de las tecnologías cuánticas de segunda generación”.\n\nArtículo original de Noticias de Gipuzkoaaquí."

        "date": "September 12, 2022",
        "content": "Las “tecnologías profundas” (Deep Tech) pueden definirse como tecnologías con altas barreras de desarrollo. Estos obstáculos son de dos tipos: (1) la alta intensidad de capital de las inversiones necesarias; y (2) la elevada incertidumbre sobre los futuros rendimientos de estas inversiones. Dichas propiedades de la Deep Tech desalientan la inversión privada e implican la necesidad de una intervención estatal correctiva. El ascenso tecnológico de China supone un reto para los países occidentales, lo que ha colocado recientemente a la Deep Tech en el centro de los grandes equilibrios geopolíticos internacionales, como nos recuerdan el reciente tira y afloja chino-estadounidense sobre el 5G y los semiconductores o la carrera de las vacunas para superar la pandemia del COVID-19. Europa, que al principio parecía febril y dividida ante este “gran desacoplamiento tecnológico” del mundo, intenta ahora adoptar una postura más ofensiva (iniciativas tecnológicas de la Presidencia francesa de la UE, y lanzamiento de la ESNA1 y del European Innovation Council), mientras que muchos Estados miembros han adoptado al mismo tiempo medidas y planes dirigidos explícitamente a las Deep Tech de tecnología punta (“Plan Deep Tech”, estrategias de aceleración y plan “France 2030” en Francia, creación del Deep Tech Future Fund-DTFF en Alemania, puesta en marcha de Breakthrough Innovation fund en el Reino Unido, etc.). Estas tecnologías parecen ser cruciales no sólo para preparar el crecimiento del mañana, sino también para garantizar la soberanía tecnológica de los Estados y de la UE.\n\n[...]\n\nLiderazgo español en computación cuántica a través del ejemplo de Multiverse Computing\n\n• Multiverse computing es una start-up fundada en 2019. La start-up donostiarra (País Vasco) proporciona software de vanguardia a los agentes del sector financiero para facilitar su integración en la computación cuántica y ganar así potencia de cálculo y escalabilidad (permitiendo que los costes marginales de producción tiendan a cero).41• España en la vanguardia de la computación cuántica. España está a la vanguardia de la investigación en este ámbito. Por ejemplo, BBVA ha formado una asociación estratégica con Multiverse para optimizar las carteras de gestión de activos. El proyecto utiliza la computación cuántica para calcular la mejor combinación de carteras tradicionales para maximizar la relación riesgo/rendimiento en todas las circunstancias.42 La Caixa también está utilizando la tecnología de computación cuántica para sus simulaciones de cálculo de riesgos basadas en modelos de aprendizaje automático (machine learning), lo que requiere la optimización de la potencia de cálculo.43• El desarrollo financiero de Multiverse Computing. La start-up ha recibido el apoyo de la Diputación Foral de Guipúzcoa a través del programa Txekintek/Ekintzaile, cuyo objetivo es financiar startups innovadoras supervisadas por el Centro de Innovación Empresarial (CEEI) local. En octubre de 2021, Multiverse obtuvo una ronda de financiación de 10 millones de euros de JME Ventures, uno de los principales fondos de capital riesgo españoles con sede en Madrid. Por último, la start-up vasca Deep Tech recibió 12,5 millones de euros de financiación del European Innovation Council (EIC),44 una agencia europea basada en los fondos Horizon, para desarrollar su principal producto, denominado Singularity, que permite a sus clientes desplegar las capacidades de la computación cuántica sin necesidad de desarrollar conocimientos internos.\n\nEl artículo completo disponibleaquí."

Este proyecto es estratégico para Adegi al figurar como “el primer centro de estas características a nivel internacional”.\n\nEduardo Junkera ha realizado estas afirmaciones durante su intervención enel Día de la Empresa que Adegi celebra con carácter anual,aunque paralizado durante dos años por la pandemia de coronavirus, en Donostia, donde ha reunido a centenares de empresarios del territorio favoreciendo, en palabras del presidente de Adegi, que “volvemos a vernos las caras y a sentirnos juntos, lo que nos da una fortaleza que no tenemos cuando estamos solos”.\n\nEste acto ha contado también conla participación del diputado general de Gipuzkoa, Markel Olano,quien ha lanzado un mensaje de“reconocimiento, confianza y futuro”. En este sentido, ha valorado la respuesta del empresariado guipuzcoano a la difícil coyuntura que ha vivido y vive en los últimos años, al tiempo que ha transmitidoel apoyo de la entidad foral a su actividad y la confianza en que de esta colaboración resultará“una Gipuzkoa más social, más verde y más competitiva”.\n\nGALARDONES\n\nEsta cita ha sido el escenario también de la entrega de los tradicionales premios que otorga la patronal guipuzcoana ala nueva empresay a la firma que se distinga por aplicarla nueva cultura de empresa, a las que este año se ha añadido un nuevo galardón a la compañía que se distinga por su apuesta porel desarrollo sostenible.\n\nEl premio a la nueva empresa ha correspondido aMultiverse Computing,un joven negocio especializado en tecnologías cuánticasque en su década de existencia ha ampliado su plantilla de los cuatro fundadores a los actuales 50 trabajadores y que aspira a cerrar el año duplicando esta cifra.\n\nUno de sus fundadores, Román Orús, se ha mostrado orgulloso de ser“embajadores de las tecnologías cuánticas de Gipuzkoa por el mundo”. Esta firma ha acaparado el interés mundial al ser capaz de aplicar la cuántica a distintos sectores de la actividad, como lo demuestra las sucesivas rondas de financiación superadas, quecomenzaron con un millón y medio de euros y la última ha alcanzado 12,5 millones.\n\nRead full article by Noticias de Gipuzkoahere"

En él se justifica comoposible estrategia preventiva por parte de Estados Unidos la amenaza de destruir las instalaciones del gigante de semiconductores TSMC. Una idea que elTaipei Timescomparaba recientemente, no sin estupor, con la estéril destrucción por parte del ejército nazi de la Stalingrad Tractor Works en Rusia. Pero Jared McKinney y Peter Harris, los autores, no opinan igual; China sólo produce el 6% de los chips que necesita su industria, de modo que sin TSMC simplemente colapsaría.\n\nEl Atlantic Council GeoTech Center asegura quehemos entrado enla década de la Geotech. Nunca desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial la tecnología y la innovación habían tenido tanta influencia en la geopolítica internacional. El problema es que no resulta fácil demostrar que en nuestro país seamos plenamente conscientes del desafío.\n\nSólola crisis de suministro de semiconductores, el apremio de sectores como el automóvil y probablemente el proyecto pre-exascala MareNostrum5 en el Barcelona Supercomputing Center(que ya es un crimen albergar una herramienta así de sofisticada y no sacarle partido)han permitido al sector TIC español arrancar del Gobierno un plan de 700 millones de euros de apoyo a la microelectrónica.

El objetivo es identificar o crear algoritmos cuánticos equivalentes a los clásicos e implementarlos en diferentes tipos de ordenadores cuánticos», diceVíctor Gaspar, responsable de desarrollo de negocio en GMV, una empresa española que coordina CUCO, en el que participan otras seis compañías, cinco centros de investigación y una universidad.\n\n«Mientras que un algoritmo clásico puede tardar años en ejecutarse, uno cuántico podría tardar segundos», dice Gaspar.\n\nEsa potente velocidad de cálculo se traduce enmenor consumo de energía, mayor eficiencia y resultados más precisos. Con la intención de avanzar en la aplicación de la computación cuántica en usos prácticos, CUCO realizará una investigación industrial para llevar a esta tecnología de un nivel de madurez tecnológica TRL 2 a TRL 3. Esto significa que algunos experimentos de computación cuántica avanzarían en su desarrollo y comenzarían a pasar por entornos de laboratorio.\n\nActualmente no tenemos la capacidad de calcular todo con exactitud. Por ejemplo, el seguimiento preciso por satélite de una mancha de petróleo en el mar requeriría elprocesamiento de miles de gigas. «Hoy en día se trabaja con modelos simplificados para conseguir aproximaciones muy útiles de estos cálculos, pero no dejan de ser aproximaciones», diceVíctor Canivell, cofundador de Qilimanjaro Quantum Tech, otra de las empresas que forman parte del consorcio en el que también participan BBVA, Repsol, Amatech, Multiverse Computing y DAS Photonics.\n\nFull article by Sevilla.abc.eshere"
